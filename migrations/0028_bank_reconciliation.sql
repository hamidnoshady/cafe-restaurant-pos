-- Phase 16 — bank & cash reconciliation.
--
-- Reconciles one account (cash 1100, or bank-clearing 1120 — the only two
-- accounts anything in this system posts to; see coa-template.ts) against a
-- manually-entered statement ending balance (decision: manual entry first, a
-- bank-file import format is deferred — see the phase doc's resolved open
-- questions). A reconciliation starts 'in_progress': the candidate journal
-- lines are every posting to the account not already claimed by an earlier
-- reconciliation (via bank_reconciliation_lines), up to the statement date —
-- so "unreconciled items carry forward" falls out of the model for free,
-- with no separate carry-forward step needed. Completing it (only once the
-- opening balance from the last completed reconciliation, plus the cleared
-- lines, matches the statement balance exactly) locks those lines: they can
-- never be un-cleared or claimed by a later reconciliation.
--
-- Deliberately NOT hooked into the fiscal-period lock (migrations 0024):
-- that trigger blocks *posting* into a date range, business-wide, on every
-- account; this is a different axis entirely — marking specific lines on
-- one specific account as matched, which must keep working regardless of
-- whether the fiscal period covering their dates is open, soft-closed, or
-- locked.
