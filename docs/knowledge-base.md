# مرکز آموزش (in-product knowledge base)

The learning centre inside the member dashboard (`/dashboard/knowledge`) plus
its editorial console in the super-admin area (`/platform/knowledge`). One
shared body of Persian content — 45 seeded guides covering every
member-facing corner of the platform — written so end users (صندوق‌دار،
گارسون، مدیر) can self-serve instead of calling support.

The super-admin console itself is deliberately *not* documented in the
member knowledge base; platform operators use this repo's `docs/` instead.

## Data model (migration `0131_knowledge_base_content.sql`)

Four platform-catalogue tables — **no `business_id`**, the same content for
every business, exempt from tenant RLS exactly like `knowledge_base_entries`
(0117) and documented in both `src/lib/tenant-tables.ts` and the
`tenant-isolation` integration test:

- `knowledge_categories` — the navigational tree (self-referencing
  `parent_id`, slug, title, icon, tone, sort order, `is_active`).
- `knowledge_tags` — cross-category labels (`slug`, `label`).
- `knowledge_articles` — the guides. `body_md` holds the markdown body;
  `section_keys text[]` maps an article to dashboard sections (the «آموزش»
  icon's deep link); `status` is `draft` | `published`; `search_tsv` is a
  generated `tsvector` ('simple' config — Persian needs tokenization, not
  stemming) weighted title/summary/body for full-text search.
- `knowledge_article_tags` — the article↔tag join.

Drafts are invisible to the member realm; authored rows keep
`created_by` / `updated_by` (seeded rows carry `seed:knowledge`).

## API surface

Member realm (tenant-scoped by login, read-only, published only):

- `GET /api/knowledge/catalogue` — categories, articles, tags for the hub.
- `GET /api/knowledge/search?q=…` — ranked full-text hits + snippets.
- `GET /api/knowledge/articles/[slug]` — one article with related reads.

Platform realm (guarded by `knowledge.manage`, full CRUD):

- `/api/platform/knowledge/categories`, `/tags`, `/articles` (+ `[id]`).

The older per-section learning link store (`/api/knowledge-base`, migration
0117) still feeds the per-page «آموزش» icon; the richer `section_keys`
mapping layered on top means the icon lands inside the new centre.

## Editing content day-to-day

`/platform/knowledge` has four tabs: **مقاله‌ها** (markdown editor with
live preview, section mapping, tags, publish/draft), **دسته‌ها** (tree
builder; deleting is refused while children/articles exist), **برچسب‌ها**,
and **بخش‌ها** (the dashboard-section key guide).

## Seeding the starter content

```bash
npm run db:migrate        # applies 0131_*
npm run db:seed-knowledge # inserts categories/tags/45 articles (idempotent)
```

Source of truth for seeded content lives in the repo so it is reviewable:

- `scripts/knowledge-seed/content.ts` — the registry: categories, tags and
  per-article metadata (title, summary, category, section mapping, tags).
- `scripts/knowledge-seed/articles/*.md` — the bodies, one file per article.

`scripts/seed-knowledge.ts` validates the registry against the filesystem
(missing/extra files, duplicate slugs, articles without any `##` heading —
the reader's on-page anchors depend on those) and upserts everything by
slug inside one transaction, so re-running refreshes content in place.

To change seeded wording, edit the `.md`/registry and re-run the seed — or
edit in the console, which the seed then overwrites on its next run (the
registry is authoritative). Hand-written articles with slugs outside the
registry are never touched.
