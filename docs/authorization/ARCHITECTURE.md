# Authorization architecture

How Eshobe decides whether a request is allowed. This is the reference the doc
comments in `src/lib/auth.ts`, `src/lib/authorize.ts`, `src/lib/setup-state.ts`
and `src/app/api/authorization-contract.test.ts` point at.

## The decision chain

```
Identity → Tenant membership → Role preset → Member overrides → Scope → Context → Resource policy → Allow / Deny
```

Every step can only ever *narrow*, with one exception noted under
[Absolute roles](#absolute-roles). The default is deny: a capability that
nothing grants is not held.

| Step | Where it lives | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | `platform_users` | Who is the human? |
| Tenant membership | `users` (one row per person per business) | Which business are they acting in, and are they still active? |
| Role preset | `ROLE_PRESETS` in `src/lib/permissions.ts` | What does this role do by default? |
| Member overrides | `users.permissions` (`{granted, revoked}`) | What has been adjusted for this person? |
| Scope | `users.location_scope` + `user_locations` | Which branches? |
| Context | business status, feature flags, industry modules | Is this business/trade/plan able to do it at all? |
| Resource policy | route bodies | Is *this* record theirs to touch? |

Identity and membership are deliberately separate tables. A person can be a
member of several businesses, and a PIN-only member of staff has
`platform_user_id = null` — they exist as a membership with no global identity
at all. Nothing in the chain may assume a platform user exists.

## Permissions are authoritative

Ordinary authorization is expressed as a **capability key**, never a role name.
`PERMISSIONS` in `src/lib/permissions.ts` is the catalogue; `PERMISSION_METADATA`
in `src/lib/permission-registry.ts` carries the label, description, risk band,
audit flag and dependencies used by the team screen.

The reason is the one failure this whole area kept producing: a role list in a
menu and a different role list on the route behind it. When both sides ask
`permissions.has("growth.manage")`, they cannot disagree. See
[UI and API must ask the same question](#ui-and-api-must-ask-the-same-question).

Effective permissions are `preset ∪ granted \ revoked`, resolved by
`effectivePermissions(role, overrides)`.

### Absolute roles

`owner` is every permission *by rule*, and overrides are not applied to it. A
business that could revoke its way out of `team.manage` on its only owner would
be permanently locked out of itself.

`admin` is every permission except `OWNER_ONLY_PERMISSIONS` (currently
`api.manage`), also by rule — but it is **not** absolute, so overrides still
apply and an admin remains reducible.

Both are rules rather than lists so that a permission added in a later release
is picked up automatically instead of silently excluding the owner from it.

## One guard

`authorize()` in `src/lib/authorize.ts` is the single decision point. The four
public guards — `requirePermission`, `requireRole`, `requireMember`,
`requireManager` — all funnel through it, so every one of them performs the
same checks:

1. a valid session;
2. the membership still exists;
3. `users.is_active`;
4. `platform_users.token_version` still matches the token (session revocation);
5. the business is active;
6. the specific role/permission demand.

This mattered: before unification, `requireRole()` authorized from the JWT's
`session.role` and re-checked only `token_version` — never `is_active`, never
the business status, never the member's *current* database role.
`requireManager()` was worse, a pure JWT comparison with no database read at
all. `requirePermission()` checked is_active and status but not
`token_version`, so a revoked session kept working. Each of those holes has a
named regression test in `src/lib/authorize.test.ts`.

Guards hand onward a session carrying the **database** role, not the token's.

### Denial contract

```ts
{ error: "unauthorized" | "forbidden" | "business_suspended",
  code: DenialCode,
  permission?: Permission }
```

`DenialCode` is one of `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `MEMBERSHIP_NOT_FOUND`,
`MEMBERSHIP_INACTIVE`, `SESSION_REVOKED`, `BUSINESS_NOT_ACTIVE`,
`MISSING_PERMISSION`, `MISSING_ROLE`, `OWNER_ONLY`, `LOCATION_FORBIDDEN`.
Status is 401 for the first, 403 otherwise. The three `error` strings are
preserved verbatim because the dashboard consumes them
(`src/app/dashboard/ui.tsx` switches on `"business_suspended"`).

## Branch scope

`users.location_scope` is an explicit enum — `all`, `selected`, `home` —
introduced by migration `0170`. Before it, a non-owner with no `user_locations`
rows and a `NULL` location_id reached **every** branch in the business, which
is the opposite of deny-by-default.

The column defaults to `home`. An unrecognised explicit scope in a request body
is a `400 invalid_location_scope`, never a silent fallback: quietly dropping it
would leave the member on a policy the caller did not ask for and believes they
changed. The migration's backfill preserves each member's current reach exactly
— legacy roamers become an explicit `all` — so nobody is narrowed at deploy.

## Role-identity checks

A small number of decisions genuinely depend on *who someone is* rather than
what they may do, and those stay role tests. They are enumerated in
`JUSTIFIED_ROLE_CHECKS` in `src/app/api/authorization-contract.test.ts`, each
with a written reason, and the allowlist is policed by two meta-tests:

- a **stale-allowlist** test, so an entry cannot silently exempt a file that has
  since grown a *different*, unreviewed role check; and
- a minimum length on the reason, so "justified" cannot be asserted by a word.

The current entries are the five AI autonomous-approval routes, `ai/chat`'s
floor-assistant selection, `setup/state`'s first-run wizard, and
`platform/ai/gateway`'s owner authority.

Everything else is a capability. `requireRole` call sites are counted by a
ratchet test that can only go down.

## UI and API must ask the same question

A menu entry, a button and the route behind them must be gated on the same key.
The failure mode is specific and was observed repeatedly:

- granting `growth.manage` to a salesperson produced an API that accepted them
  behind a menu that never appeared; and
- revoking `growth.view` from a manager left every Growth screen visible with
  every fetch inside it returning 403.

Practical rules:

- Server components resolve `memberAccessFor(session)` and gate on
  `permissions.has(...)`.
- A `Set` cannot cross into a client component. Serialise as an array and
  rebuild it with `useMemo(() => new Set(permissions), [permissions])`.
- Nav items carry `requiredAnyPermission`, never a `roles` list.
- `session.role` may still reach a *view* as presentation (a label, an
  empty-state hint). It must never be the input to a gate;
  `src/app/navigation-route-guards.test.ts` asserts the negative.

## Delegating team administration

Three keys, deliberately separate:

| Key | Covers |
|---|---|
| `team.view` | See the team list |
| `team.manage` | Create staff, rename, suspend, re-branch, reset credentials |
| `team.permissions.manage` | Change a member's role or permission overrides |

Handing out capability is how a delegated team administrator would escalate, so
it is gated apart from ordinary administration — a suspend or a rename still
needs nothing more than `team.manage`, so no existing workflow breaks.

On top of that, `escalationRefusal()` in `src/lib/team.ts` refuses two moves by
anyone who is not an owner:

1. **Granting beyond yourself.** The permissions an edit *adds* must be a subset
   of what the editor already holds. Only additions are measured — removing
   access is never escalation, and testing the whole resulting set instead would
   wrongly block a manager from adjusting an accountant whose preset contains
   `ledger.post`.
2. **Changing your own role.** Not caught by the permission delta, because of
   the role-identity checks above: someone could move to a role whose permission
   set is a subset of their current one and still cross one of those gates.

`api.manage` is owner-only and is stripped by `sanitizeOverrides` as well as
refused by `effectivePermissions`, so it cannot be granted through this path at
all. Owner safety is completed by the last-owner rule in `checkLastOwner`.

## Separate realms

- **Superadmin** is a different realm entirely (`platform-auth.ts`), not a
  tenant role, and never appears in `ROLE_PRESETS`.
- **API keys** are separate scoped identities (`api-scopes.ts`), not a member's
  permissions borrowed.
- **AI** acts as the requesting member and is bounded by that member's effective
  permissions; autonomy level is a separate, role-gated decision.

## Tenant isolation

None of the above replaces RLS. Every tenant read runs inside an explicit
`withTenant(businessId, …)` scope, and the permission layer sits on top of that
boundary rather than in place of it.
