# OpenObserve — fleet monitoring for the super-admin console

> Status: the integration is in the app (shipper + `/api/platform/observability` +

## Why this and not "more tables in Postgres"

`/platform/system` («سلامت») answers *"what does **this** deployment's database
think?"* — pool, migrations, RLS, last backup per business. It is a good answer
and it can never be a better one: a single page can only see the node serving it.
The fleet has problems that are not database-shaped:

- a café's local box throws errors every night in the backup tick — and the
  central console finds out only when someone reports data missing;
- a deploy made request latency silently double on one host but not the others;
- `console.error` from the twelve background ticks in `server.ts` exists for
  about one boot in RAM (the docker log), and then never again;
- "did the update on site 3 actually restart?" is answered by nothing today.

OpenObserve is one container (~200 MB RAM idle) that becomes the answer to all
of it: append-only log/metric store, SQL over it, retention pruning, alerts,
and a UI. It is chosen over the Loki/Grafana/Tempo stack specifically because
this deployment style — one Rust binary, `docker compose up`, no sidecars —
matches how café servers are actually administered.

## How the app connects

```
┌ pos container ──────────────────────────────┐
│ server.ts                                   │
│  ├ installObservability()  → console.* tap  │   POST /api/{org}/{stream}/_json
│  └ res "finish" (status≥400 or ≥1s)        │   (buffered, batched, never blocks,
│                                             │    drops counted, app unaffected)
│ /api/platform/observability (system.read)   │   POST /api/{org}/_search?type=logs
│  └ «پایش» tab proxies through here          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘          │
                                              ┌──────────▼──────────┐
                                              │ openobserve:5080    │
                                              │  pos_app_logs stream│
                                              │  dashboards / alerts│
                                              └─────────────────────┘
```

Facts the code relies on (the dev mock mirrors them, so drift shows up in review):

- **Ingest**: `POST /api/{org}/{stream}/_json` — array of objects,
  `_timestamp` in **microseconds**; Basic auth `email:password`.
- **Search**: `POST /api/{org}/_search?type=logs` with
  `{ query: { sql, start_time, end_time, from, size } }` — again µs; response
  rows arrive under `results` (newer) or `hits` (older) — the client accepts both.
- **Health**: `GET /health/z`. **Streams**: `GET /api/{org}/streams?type=logs`.
- The browser never talks to the collector. The console's tab calls
  `/api/platform/observability`, which is session+`system.read`-gated and
  proxies server-side. Credentials exist only in the app container's env.

### What gets shipped

| source | fields | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `console.*` tap | `level, message, logger:"console", service, environment` | every existing `console.error("… tick failed")` becomes observable with zero call-site churn; originals keep printing |
| HTTP finish | `logger:"http", method, path, status, duration_ms, host` | only `status ≥ 400` or `duration ≥ 1000ms` — the interesting tail, not the whole firehose (ingestion cost is the billing of this world) |
| boot | `logger:"boot"` | one record per process start: "did the new deploy come up, from where" |
| `uncaughtException` / `unhandledRejection` | `level:"fatal"/"error"` | best-effort flush before the process goes down |

Record fields to care about in queries: `service` (which host/site — set
`OPENOBSERVE_SERVICE` per box!), `environment`, `level`, `host` (request Host
header → which tenant origin was hit), `status`, `duration_ms`.

## Installing it

### A. Central server (Komodo / archive/deploy/docker-compose.komodo.yml — retired)

```bash
# once, on the server, in the stack folder:
export OPENOBSERVE_ROOT_EMAIL=ops@yourdomain.ir
export OPENOBSERVE_ROOT_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -base64 18)"
docker compose -f archive/deploy/docker-compose.komodo.yml -f archive/deploy/docker-compose.observability.yml up -d
```

That is the whole install: the overlay starts OpenObserve on the private
network, injects the `OPENOBSERVE_*` env into the app, and creates the
`zo-data` volume. The collector listens **only** inside that network.

Optional — publish its UI (dashboards/alert config need it at first; the
console's tab works regardless): uncomment the Traefik labels in the overlay
and set `OPENOBSERVE_PUBLIC_URL=https://obs.yourdomain.ir`.

### B. Café box (docker-compose.local.yml)

Two choices, mixable:

1. **Report up**: no new container — add to the box's `.env`:
   `OPENOBSERVE_URL=https://obs.yourdomain.ir`, `OPENOBSERVE_USER`,
   `OPENOBSERVE_PASSWORD`, `OPENOBSERVE_SERVICE=cafe-north`. Works while the
   internet is up; the shipper drops (and counts) while it isn't — which is
   the correct café-box behavior anyway.
2. **Self-contained LAN**: `docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml -f
   archive/deploy/docker-compose.observability.local.yml up -d` — a local collector at
   `http://<lan-ip>:5080`, 14-day retention, nothing leaves the premises.

### C. Bare-metal / systemd

Download the single binary from <https://openobserve.ai/downloads/>, then:

```bash
ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL=ops@yourdomain.ir ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD=... \
ZO_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/openobserve ZO_COMPACT_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=60 \
./openobserve
```

and set the four `OPENOBSERVE_*` vars on the app service unit. Restart both.

### D. RunFlare (managed Docker PaaS — no compose file)

Platforms like [RunFlare](https://runflare.com) deploy **one service at a time**
(a Docker image, or a folder pushed with `runflare deploy` / GitHub-GitLab CI)
instead of a full compose file, so the overlay from **A** cannot be applied
directly. Nothing changes in the app image — you replicate the same wiring
with platform features: a second service, a disk, env vars, and an optional
subdomain.

1. **Create an OpenObserve service in the same project as the app.** Service
   type Docker, image `openobserve/openobserve:latest` (Docker Hub is covered
   by RunFlare's `mirror-docker.runflare.com`, so the pull is fast; the
   upstream ECR registry is not mirrored). If the dashboard has no image
   field, deploy a folder containing a one-line Dockerfile —
   `FROM openobserve/openobserve:latest` — via CLI/CI. Set the app port to
   **5080** (OpenObserve's only port) and ≥ 1 GB RAM.
2. **Attach a persistent disk** («ساخت دیسک جدید» / add a disk to the project,
   mounted on the service) at `/data`, and set `ZO_DATA_DIR=/data` — otherwise
   the log store is wiped on every redeploy. RunFlare's disk backups then
   cover the log archive too.
3. **Env vars on the collector service** (root pair is read on first boot
   only; change the password in the UI afterwards):
   `ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL`, `ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD`, `ZO_DATA_DIR=/data`,
   `ZO_COMPACT_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=30`.
4. **Env vars on the app service**, then redeploy it (the shipper reads env
   at boot): `OPENOBSERVE_URL=http://<openobserve-service-name>:5080` if the
   project's internal network resolves service names, else attach a subdomain
   to the collector («اتصال دامنه به سرویس», e.g. `https://obs.yourdomain.com`)
   and use that — the UI and ingestion both sit behind OpenObserve's own
   login. Either way add `OPENOBSERVE_USER` / `OPENOBSERVE_PASSWORD`, and
   `OPENOBSERVE_SERVICE=pos-central` per project if you run more than one.
5. **Verify:** `GET /api/platform/observability?mode=config` → `configured:
   true`, `shipper.sent` climbing; or the console page «پایش» shows rows.
   If the internal hostname does not resolve, fall back to the subdomain.

The compose overlays and `archive/deploy/docker-compose.observability.yml` remain the
reference for what these services do; RunFlare just assembles them from its
own building blocks.

### E. Local development — no Docker at all

```bash
node scripts/dev-openobserve.mjs     # contract-faithful in-memory mock on :5080
OPENOBSERVE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5080 OPENOBSERVE_USER=root@example.com \
OPENOBSERVE_PASSWORD=devpass npm run dev
```

Open `/platform/system/logs` → data flows. The mock is dev-only: no retention,
no dashboards, memory-capped.

## Verifying it is alive

```bash
# ingest works (from the app's own stream):
curl -s -u "$OPENOBSERVE_USER:$OPENOBSERVE_PASSWORD" \
  "$OPENOBSERVE_URL/api/default/_search?type=logs" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"query\":{\"sql\":\"SELECT * FROM \\\"pos_app_logs\\\" ORDER BY _timestamp DESC\",\"start_time\":$(( ($(date +%s) - 3600) * 1000000 )),\"end_time\":$(( $(date +%s) * 1000000 )),\"size\":5}}"
```

or just watch «پایش» in the console: a boot record appears within seconds of
the app starting, and `mode=config` shows `shipper.sent` climbing. If
`dropped` climbs instead, the collector is unreachable — the POS does not
care, but you now do.

## Alert recipes worth adding on day one

In OpenObserve UI → Alerts, each is a saved query + channel (email/Telegram/
webhook). These map directly onto failure modes this platform has seen:

```sql
-- any ticket-critical job failing at all, last 15 min
SELECT count(*) AS n FROM "pos_app_logs"
WHERE level IN ('error','fatal') AND str_match(message, 'tick failed')

-- backups: a site that stopped reporting success entirely (24h silence = alert)
SELECT service, max(_timestamp) AS last_seen FROM "pos_app_logs"
WHERE str_match(message, 'backup') GROUP BY service HAVING last_seen < now() - interval '24 hours'
```

plus the infra-shaped ones from the other side (metrics, once the node exporter
is added): disk on the `zo-data` / `pos-pgdata` volume, pool queue > 0, HTTP
5xx rate per `host` (i.e. per tenant origin).

## Retention, size, privacy

- `ZO_COMPACT_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS` (60 central / 14 per-box in the overlays) is
  the prune lever. At the volumes this app logs — errors, slow requests, one
  line per tick — 60 days is hundreds of MB, not GB.
- Logs contain paths, tenant *hosts*, and error text — no passwords, tokens or
  payment data are written by the shipper (messages come from `console.*` in
  code that already prints them to docker logs today; nothing new is exposed
  inside the same server boundary). If you front the OpenObserve UI, it is
  Basic-auth only: put it behind the same VPN/IP-allowlist discipline you use
  for anything with production logs, or leave the port unpublished and use
  the console tab (which is session-gated) as the operator surface.
- The DB remains the source of truth for *business* audit (`platform_audit_log`
  — what admins did). OpenObserve is for *machine* health. The console links
  «رویدادها» and «پایش» side by side for exactly this reason: don't replace one
  with the other.

## Roadmap this unlocks (not built yet)

1. **Desktop/electron clients** → `fetch(centralOrigin + "/api/platform/...")`
   is already how updates are checked; a `desktop_logs` stream (crashes,
   print-job failures per `businessId`) would give the console per-install
   field visibility. Needs a thin ingest proxy under the app (so client builds
   hold no collector credentials) and stream-name allowlisting.
2. **Postgres logs** → `docker compose` logging driver or `vector` tailing
   the db container into the same collector: slow-query log becomes queryable
   per site without touching Postgres config.
3. **Metrics** → OTLP endpoint is built into OpenObserve; a 10-line
   `@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics` exporter in `server.ts` (pool stats, tick
   durations, order latency histogram) is the next increment after this one.
