# CRM architecture

How the CRM app is built, what it owns, and — more usefully — the rules it
follows and why each one exists. Most of these rules were written after
something went wrong; where that is the case, the failure is described, because
a rule whose reason has been forgotten is a rule that gets removed the first
time it is inconvenient.

## What the CRM owns

The CRM owns the **relationship** with a customer: who they are to us, what
we have promised them, what we are selling them, and what they have consented
to. It owns leads, deals and pipelines, activities and tasks, service cases,
segments, notes, consent records, and the reconciliation queue for online
shoppers.

It owns **no financial, campaign or website source of truth**. Those live in
Accounting, Growth and Website respectively, and the CRM reads them through
their services.

### `parties` is canonical

There is one identity record per person, in `parties`, shared by every app. A
customer, a supplier and a member of staff can be the same row with several
roles. The CRM does not have a `contacts` table and must never grow one: a
second identity table means one person split across two rows that can never be
reconciled, and every report thereafter has to guess which is real.

Leads are the one deliberate exception, and they are not an exception to the
rule so much as a statement of it — see below.

## The four hard rules

These are enforced by `src/lib/crm-app-boundaries.test.ts`, which reads the
CRM's own source. Two of the rules failed on their first run against existing
code, which is the argument for having them.

### 1. The CRM does not re-derive money

Every financial figure comes from Accounting, through
`src/lib/crm-accounting-contract.ts`. That module adds no arithmetic; it is a
typed, read-only facade.

A/R attribution is the reason. A receivable line names a customer through the
order, the receipt or the cheque that caused it, and closed-order corrections
arrive through `order_amendments` pointing back at the original order. Miss the
amendment bridge and a corrected invoice silently detaches from its customer. A
second implementation *will* miss something, and when the CRM says a customer
owes ۲٬۰۰۰٬۰۰۰ and the trial balance disagrees, nobody can tell which is lying —
and the CRM's number is the wrong one.

Accounting therefore exports the attribution SQL itself
(`AR_CUSTOMER_ATTRIBUTION_SQL`, `arBalanceByCustomerSql`). There are two
legitimate call shapes and neither can be expressed in terms of the other:

- one customer at a time, for a customer file;
- every customer at once as a CTE, for the segment engine — which joins A/R
  against tens of thousands of parties and cannot call a per-customer function
  without turning one query into an N+1 over the whole directory.

Both use the same fragment. Reusing Accounting's exported SQL is permitted;
hand-written ledger SQL in the CRM is not.

### 2. Winning a deal posts nothing

No CRM module writes to `orders`, `order_items`, `journal_entries`,
`journal_lines` or `ar_receipts`. Moving a deal to «برنده» writes no journal
line and issues no invoice.

Three reasons, in order of severity:

1. Dragging a card between two columns is a low-ceremony gesture performed by
   salespeople on phones. Issuing a financial document has tax consequences.
   Wiring the first to the second means the income statement can be moved by a
   mis-drag.
2. The real invoice is raised in Accounting regardless — that is where stock,
   pricing, tax and payment terms live. A deal that also posted would book the
   same sale twice.
3. A deal's value is a forecast. An invoice line needs a quantity, a unit
   price, a tax treatment and a catalogue item. Converting the first into the
   second invents four facts nobody supplied.

`src/lib/crm-deal-handoff.ts` is the bridge: it validates that a deal is ready,
deep-links into Accounting with the customer and deal pre-filled, and records
the resulting document against the deal afterwards. The CRM observes the sale;
it does not cause it.

### 3. Consent is never manufactured

Buying something is not permission to be marketed to. No import, sync or
conversion path writes `sms_consent` or `marketing_consent`. Only an explicit
consent action does, and it writes an audit row alongside.

This includes lead conversion: a lead has no consent columns to copy, by
design.

### 4. Identity is never guessed

No query resolves an ambiguous person with `ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 1`.

This one is written in blood. The WooCommerce sync used to answer every
identity question whether or not it could: two customers sharing a billing
phone — a family, a couple, one work number — and it attached the order to
whichever record was created first. Nothing failed. The purchase simply entered
the wrong person's history, their spend total, their RFM score, and every
segment and campaign derived from them.

`findIdentityCandidates` returns **all** matches. One match auto-links with a
recorded confidence; two or more park the profile as `needs_review` and the
order is imported unattributed until a human decides. A visible queue of five
unresolved shoppers is a far better state than five silently misattributed
ones.

The same rule governs lead conversion (below) and the duplicate-merge screen.

## Leads are not parties

A lead is an unqualified enquiry. Most never buy. If every enquiry became a
`parties` row, the directory would fill with non-customers, «چند مشتری داریم؟»
would stop meaning anything, and every purchase-behaviour segment would be
diluted.

So `crm_leads` is its own table, and a lead becomes a party exactly once, at
conversion, through `convertLead`. That function:

1. Locks the lead — inside a real transaction (see below).
2. Refuses if already converted. Idempotence at the data level, not at the
   button.
3. Runs the duplicate check.
4. Creates or links the party through `createParty`, so field encryption, blind
   indexes, phone normalisation and accounting codes all happen the one way
   they are meant to. Writing the INSERT by hand here is how a record ends up
   unsearchable by phone.
5. Optionally opens a deal in the default pipeline's first open stage.
6. Marks the lead converted, pointing at both halves.

**The duplicate check can refuse.** Zero matches converts. One match is offered
to the user as a question. Two or more **stops the conversion** — there is no
honest way for a server to choose, and `acknowledgeDuplicates` does not
override it. The user picks a specific `partyId` or fixes the duplicates first.

Converted leads are immutable: they have become a party, and editing the husk
they left behind would silently diverge from the record people actually use.

## Pipelines are rows, not an enum

Every business sells differently — a jeweller has «ارزیابی» and «سفارش ساخت»
where a café has neither. The enum version shipped first and the first question
anyone asked was how to rename a stage.

What makes renaming safe is that **reporting keys on each stage's `outcome`**
(`open` / `won` / `lost`), never on its name. Rename «برنده» and every
historical win rate still means the same thing.

Related decisions:

- `crm_deals.stage` (the legacy text column) is still written, kept in step by
  `legacyStageKey()`. Bookmarked URLs, cached browser bundles and external
  callers still send the old six-value key; rejecting them would break working
  integrations to gain nothing. Legacy keys resolve into the real pipeline, so
  those callers get stage history too.
- `savePipelineStages` is whole-list in one transaction, because ordering is a
  property of the set. It refuses to delete a stage holding deals (they would
  become invisible on every board and every forecast), and requires at least
  one `open` and one `won` stage (without them, deals cannot be created or
  closed and the win rate is structurally zero).
- `defaultPipeline()` **lazily seeds**. Migration 0157 only backfilled
  businesses that existed when it ran, and there are three separate
  provisioning paths. Self-healing on read is the only version that a fourth
  path cannot break.
- Velocity uses `percentile_cont(0.5)` — the median. Dwell times are
  long-tailed and one deal parked over Nowruz would drag a mean into
  meaninglessness.

## `withTenantTransaction`, and why `withTenant` is not enough

`withTenant` establishes the RLS scope. It is **not** a transaction. Each
`query()` inside it checks out its own pooled connection, so a sequence of
writes is a sequence of independent autocommits — and, critically,
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` releases its lock the instant that statement's
connection returns to the pool.

That makes a lock-then-check-then-write guard silently useless. Two
simultaneous requests both take the lock (sequentially, each on its own
connection), both see the pre-write state, and both proceed. This was a real,
demonstrated bug: a double-clicked convert button produced two customers, and
the same broken pattern existed in `mergeCustomers`, `resolveExternalProfile`
and several other places.

`withTenantTransaction` pins one client under `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` and redirects
`query()` to it, so every call site is fixed without changing its SQL.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- Statements issued on a pinned client are **chained**, because one pg client
  cannot run concurrent queries. `Promise.all` inside a transaction does not
  parallelise anything; it warns and, on some driver versions, interleaves
  results onto the wrong promises. Serialising is structural rather than a rule
  to remember.
- Use plain `withTenant` for reads and single writes — it does not hold a
  connection for the duration. Use `withTenantTransaction` for any multi-write
  invariant and for **any** `FOR UPDATE` or advisory lock.

## RFM freshness is a job, never a hook

RFM is a whole-population property: a customer is in the top recency quintile
only relative to everyone else. So "rescore because this person just bought
something" means scanning every customer and every order.

Doing that at checkout would put a full-table aggregation on the path of taking
money — the till waits for a report on a busy Friday — and, worse, a failure in
a *reporting* calculation would fail the *sale*.

So checkout calls `markScoringDirtyIn`: one upsert of one row, inside the
existing payment transaction, so a rolled-back sale rolls back the mark too.
`runCrmScoringTick` (every 15 minutes) does the scanning, with:

- a **debounce**, so a lunch rush is one scan rather than two hundred;
- a **daily floor**, because recency decays with the calendar and no order will
  ever arrive to signal it — a shop closed for Nowruz must not reopen to scores
  frozen at the moment it shut;
- **stale-claim reclamation**, so a worker killed mid-run does not freeze one
  tenant's scores forever.

Staleness is reported rather than hidden. Never-scored reads as a null age, not
zero — zero means "scored just now", which is the opposite of the truth. A
score presented as current when it is two days old is a lie the reader cannot
detect.

## Case SLA pauses while waiting on the customer

A case's age is not the time since it opened. Some of that was spent waiting
for the customer to send their order number.

Counting that against the team causes three failures: reports say the team is
failing when it is not, so they get ignored; the fastest way to protect the
number becomes *not asking the customer anything*; and genuinely-neglected
cases are buried among false positives.

`waiting_seconds` accumulates every waiting stretch and is subtracted. It is a
**stored running total**, not derived at read time, because a case can bounce
between waiting and active a dozen times and a status column only knows where
the case is now. Closing out the stretch on every exit from `waiting` is what
stops a bouncing case silently improving its own SLA.

`first_response_at` is stamped once and never moved. "Somebody acknowledged me"
and "my problem is fixed" are different promises; collapsing them hides the case
that got a fast reply and then sat for two weeks. Closing an untouched case does
not count as a response.

`waitingOnCustomer` is reported as its own figure and never folded into
`breached`.

## Merge is irreversible, human-only, and registry-driven

Merging two customers rewrites every order, invoice, receipt and note that
pointed at the loser and archives it. It cannot be undone.

- It requires its own permission (`crm.merge`), separate from
  `crm.manage`. "Clean up the duplicates" is exactly the task a business
  delegates to its newest employee.
- It is absent from the AI assistant and autopilot surfaces, along with every
  other irreversible or judgement-bearing CRM action.
- The references it moves come from `src/lib/party-merge-references.ts`, a
  registry derived from FK metadata, not a hand-written list. The hand-written
  list fell one table behind every feature that linked something to a customer,
  and the symptom was silent.

## Permissions

CRM permissions split by **blast radius**, not by screen:

| Permission | What it protects |
|---|---|
| `crm.view` | Reading the 360° file, pipeline, segments, reports |
| `crm.manage` | Day-to-day work: notes, tasks, activities, cases, deals |
| `crm.merge` | The one irreversible action |
| `crm.consent_manage` | A legal record: who may lawfully be contacted |
| `crm.export` | Walking out with the customer list |
| `crm.configure` | Reshaping stages and segments every report is keyed to |

Bundling these into one `crm.manage` would mean granting a junior salesperson
the ability to destroy the directory in order to let them log a phone call.

Presets preserve existing access: manager keeps everything it could already
reach (introducing a permission must not silently remove access somebody had —
that is an outage, not a security improvement), and cashier gets `crm.manage`
only, matching what the nav already showed them.

## Testing

| Gate | Command |
|---|---|
| Types | `npx tsc --noEmit` |
| Unit | `npm test` |
| Database | `npm run test:db` (~8 min) |
| Design | `npm run test:design` |
| Build | `npm run build` |

Boundary rules live in `src/lib/crm-app-boundaries.test.ts` and run in the unit
suite. They read source rather than behaviour on purpose: a future change that
"helpfully" rescores after a sale, or adds one more ledger query to the CRM,
would pass every behavioural test in the repository.
