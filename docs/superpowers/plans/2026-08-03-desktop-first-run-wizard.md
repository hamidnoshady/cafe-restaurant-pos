# Desktop First-Run Wizard Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Give a fresh Electron desktop install a first-run choice between setting up a brand-new local-only business and pairing with an existing business on the online platform via a one-time code.

**Architecture:** `/welcome` becomes a three-state client shell (`choosing` → `local` | `connecting`). The local path reuses today's `POST /api/setup/bootstrap` unchanged apart from a new `deploymentMode` field that stamps `settings['deployment.mode']` and seeds `business_features` "off" overrides. The connected path adds a new `install_pairing_codes` table on the **online** server (issued from the super-admin console), a public `POST /api/platform/pairing/redeem` that trades a code for a full `PairingSnapshot`, and a public `POST /api/setup/pair` on the **local** install that fetches that snapshot and replays it into the empty local database with every ID preserved verbatim. The same codebase runs on both sides — which half executes depends only on which install you are.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15 App Router (TypeScript), PostgreSQL 16 with row-level security, vitest (unit + integration), Electron 3x with `embedded-postgres`, bcryptjs, node:crypto.

## Global Constraints

- **Persian-first UI.** Every user-visible string is Persian (RTL). Digits shown to a user go through `toPersianDigits` from `@/lib/digits` where the surrounding code already does; the pairing code itself stays Latin/ASCII and `dir="ltr"`.
- **Money in integer Rial, dates ISO/Gregorian in storage.** Nothing in this plan touches money, but don't introduce float or Jalali storage anywhere.
- **A new tenant-scoped table needs an RLS policy in the same migration that creates it.** `integration/tenant-isolation.integration.test.ts` fails otherwise, and that failure is a real bug.
- **Migrations are forward-only.** Add `migrations/0048_install_pairing_codes.sql`; never edit an applied migration.
- **`withoutTenantScope()` calls are holes in the isolation boundary.** This plan adds exactly two, both fitting existing justified categories: `redeemPairingCode` (resolve a bearer-style credential to its business before a tenant is chosen — the `server-sync-auth` shape) and `applyPairingSnapshot` (creates the tenant that scoping would otherwise require — the `platform` shape, same as `provisionBusiness`).
- **Anything under `src/lib/` that is pure gets a `*.test.ts` alongside it.** DB-touching files (`query()`/`getPool()`) are the documented exception and are covered by integration tests instead.
- **Platform capability names are dot-separated.** The capability for issuing/revoking pairing codes is `business.provision` (owner-only). There is no `businesses:write`.
- **Platform route handlers guard with `requirePlatformCapability(...)` and wrap in `withPlatformScope(...)`**, never `requireRole`/`requirePermission`.
- **Pairing code plaintext is shown exactly once** and only its sha-256 is stored, following `invitations.token_hash`.
- **Before every commit:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test`, `npm run test:db`, `npm run build` must all pass. They mirror the CI `test` job exactly.

**Full pre-commit sequence (run from repo root):**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test
npm run test:db      # needs Postgres: docker compose up -d
npm run build        # JWT_SECRET only needs to be set to *something*
```

## File Structure

**New files (online / issuing side):**

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `migrations/0048_install_pairing_codes.sql` | `install_pairing_codes` table, partial unique index, RLS policy |
| `src/lib/pairing-codes.ts` | **Pure.** Code generation, normalisation, hashing, redeemability check |
| `src/lib/pairing-codes.test.ts` | Unit tests for the above |
| `src/lib/pairing-service.ts` | **DB.** Issue / revoke / list codes, build snapshot, redeem code |
| `src/app/api/platform/pairing/route.ts` | `GET` list, `POST` issue, `DELETE` revoke — `business.provision` |
| `src/app/api/platform/pairing/redeem/route.ts` | `POST` public — the code is the credential |
| `src/app/platform/businesses/[id]/pairing-panel.tsx` | Console UI: issue, show-once, revoke, status |

**New files (local / redeeming side):**

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/pairing-snapshot.ts` | **Pure.** `PairingSnapshot` type + `validateSnapshot()` shape check |
| `src/lib/pairing-snapshot.test.ts` | Unit tests for the above |
| `src/lib/pairing-apply.ts` | **DB.** `applyPairingSnapshot()` — one bypassed transaction, snapshot IDs preserved |
| `src/app/api/setup/pair/route.ts` | Public — `{ remoteUrl, code }` → redeem → validate → apply → sign in |
| `src/app/welcome/mode-choice.tsx` | Two-card mode screen |
| `src/app/welcome/pair-form.tsx` | Pairing-code entry with per-error Persian messages |
| `src/app/setup/backup/page.tsx` | New optional wizard step: local backup destination |

**New files (shared):**

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/deployment-mode.ts` | **Pure + one DB read.** `DeploymentMode` type, `LOCAL_DISABLED_FEATURES`, `resolveDeploymentMode()`, `readDeploymentMode()`, `isLocalOnly()` |
| `src/lib/deployment-mode.test.ts` | Unit tests for the pure half |
| `integration/pairing.integration.test.ts` | End-to-end: issue → redeem → apply, plus RLS and re-redeem refusal |

**Modified files:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/settings.ts` | `+ deploymentMode: "deployment.mode"` in `SETTING_KEYS` |
| `src/lib/business-provisioning.ts` | `+ deploymentMode?: DeploymentModeName` on input; stamps the setting and seeds disabled flags |

| `src/app/welcome/page.tsx` | Three-state shell |
| `src/middleware.ts` | `+ "/api/setup/pair"` to `PUBLIC_PATHS`; `+ "/api/platform/pairing/redeem"` to `PLATFORM_PUBLIC_PATHS` |
| `src/lib/setup-state.ts` | `+ "backup"` to `WIZARD_STEPS` and `OPTIONAL_STEPS` |
| `src/app/setup/steps.ts` | `+` the backup step entry |
| `src/app/api/backup/config/route.ts` | Refuse `cloud.enabled === true` in local mode |
| `src/app/dashboard/backup/backup-manager.tsx` | Hide the cloud section in local mode |
| `src/app/api/backup/config/route.ts` (GET) | Return `localOnly` so the client can hide the cloud section |
| `src/app/platform/ui.tsx` | `+` pairing error codes to `errorMessage` |
| `src/app/platform/businesses/[id]/page.tsx` | Mount `<PairingPanel />` |
| `electron/preload.js` | Expose `window.desktop.pickFolder()` |
| `electron/main.js` | `ipcMain.handle("pick-folder", …)` |
| `src/lib/db.ts` | Extend the `withoutTenantScope` doc comment with the pairing reason |

## Task ordering

Tasks 1–4 are the shared foundation and the online issuing side. Tasks 5–7 are the local redeeming side. Tasks 8–10 are UI. Tasks 11–12 are the local-mode backup story and the Electron bridge. Each task ends green and committable.

---

### Task 1: Deployment mode — pure logic and the settings key

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/deployment-mode.ts`
- Create: `src/lib/deployment-mode.test.ts`
- Modify: `src/lib/settings.ts` (the `SETTING_KEYS` object, around line 31)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `getSetting`, `SETTING_KEYS` from `./settings`.
- Produces:
  - `type DeploymentModeName = "local" | "connected"`
  - `interface DeploymentMode { mode: DeploymentModeName; pairedAt: string | null }`
  - `const LOCAL_DISABLED_FEATURES: readonly string[]`
  - `function resolveDeploymentMode(stored: unknown): DeploymentMode` (pure)
  - `async function readDeploymentMode(businessId: string): Promise<DeploymentMode>`
  - `async function isLocalOnly(businessId: string): Promise<boolean>`

---

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the settings key**

In `src/lib/settings.ts`, inside the `SETTING_KEYS` object, after the `appUpdateStatus` line:

```ts
  /** DeploymentMode (src/lib/deployment-mode.ts) — { mode: 'local'|'connected', pairedAt } */
  deploymentMode: "deployment.mode",
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing test**

Create `src/lib/deployment-mode.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";
import { LOCAL_DISABLED_FEATURES, resolveDeploymentMode } from "./deployment-mode";

describe("resolveDeploymentMode", () => {
  it("treats an absent setting as connected, so installs predating this feature are unaffected", () => {
    expect(resolveDeploymentMode(null)).toEqual({ mode: "connected", pairedAt: null });
    expect(resolveDeploymentMode(undefined)).toEqual({ mode: "connected", pairedAt: null });
  });

  it("reads a stored local mode", () => {
    expect(resolveDeploymentMode({ mode: "local", pairedAt: null })).toEqual({
      mode: "local",
      pairedAt: null,
    });
  });

  it("keeps the paired timestamp on a connected install", () => {
    expect(resolveDeploymentMode({ mode: "connected", pairedAt: "2026-08-03T10:00:00.000Z" })).toEqual(
      { mode: "connected", pairedAt: "2026-08-03T10:00:00.000Z" },
    );
  });

  it("falls back to connected for a malformed value rather than locking features off", () => {
    expect(resolveDeploymentMode({ mode: "banana" })).toEqual({ mode: "connected", pairedAt: null });
    expect(resolveDeploymentMode("local")).toEqual({ mode: "connected", pairedAt: null });
    expect(resolveDeploymentMode(42)).toEqual({ mode: "connected", pairedAt: null });
  });

  it("drops a non-string pairedAt", () => {
    expect(resolveDeploymentMode({ mode: "local", pairedAt: 12345 })).toEqual({
      mode: "local",
      pairedAt: null,
    });
  });
});

describe("LOCAL_DISABLED_FEATURES", () => {
  it("disables exactly the three platform-dependent features", () => {
    expect([...LOCAL_DISABLED_FEATURES].sort()).toEqual([
      "ai_assistant",
      "multi_location",
      "offline_mode",
    ]);
  });

  it("leaves the fully-local features alone", () => {
    for (const key of ["backup", "inventory", "ledger", "reservations", "delivery", "reporting"]) {
      expect(LOCAL_DISABLED_FEATURES).not.toContain(key);
    }
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the test to verify it fails**

Run: `npx vitest run src/lib/deployment-mode.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `Failed to resolve import "./deployment-mode"`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the implementation**

Create `src/lib/deployment-mode.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * How this install relates to the online platform.
 *
 * Written once, at first run: the local path of the /welcome wizard stamps
 * 'local', the pairing path stamps 'connected'. It is deliberately not
 * changeable from the UI afterwards — upgrading a local install to a connected
 * one means merging two datasets, which is out of scope.
 *
 * An install that predates this setting reads as 'connected', so every
 * existing VPS deployment and every already-paired laptop keeps exactly the
 * behaviour it has today with no backfill migration.
 */
import { getSetting, SETTING_KEYS } from "./settings";

export type DeploymentModeName = "local" | "connected";

export interface DeploymentMode {
  mode: DeploymentModeName;
  /** ISO time the pairing completed; null for a local install. */
  pairedAt: string | null;
}

/**
 * Features a local-only install cannot deliver, seeded as `business_features`
 * "off" overrides at local bootstrap. Each is off because it depends on the
 * platform, not because it is unfinished:
 *
 *   - ai_assistant  — credits and billing live on the platform (Phase 18)
 *   - multi_location — rollup across branches is a platform function
 *   - offline_mode   — gates server-sync and rollup, meaningless standalone
 *
 * They stay individually flippable from the platform console afterwards.
 */
export const LOCAL_DISABLED_FEATURES: readonly string[] = [
  "ai_assistant",
  "multi_location",
  "offline_mode",
] as const;

/** Pure: turn whatever is stored (possibly nothing, possibly junk) into a usable mode. */
export function resolveDeploymentMode(stored: unknown): DeploymentMode {
  const fallback: DeploymentMode = { mode: "connected", pairedAt: null };
  if (typeof stored !== "object" || stored === null) return fallback;
  const raw = stored as { mode?: unknown; pairedAt?: unknown };
  if (raw.mode !== "local" && raw.mode !== "connected") return fallback;
  return {
    mode: raw.mode,
    pairedAt: typeof raw.pairedAt === "string" ? raw.pairedAt : null,
  };
}

export async function readDeploymentMode(businessId: string): Promise<DeploymentMode> {
  return resolveDeploymentMode(await getSetting<unknown>(businessId, SETTING_KEYS.deploymentMode));
}

export async function isLocalOnly(businessId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  return (await readDeploymentMode(businessId)).mode === "local";
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the test to verify it passes**

Run: `npx vitest run src/lib/deployment-mode.test.ts`
Expected: PASS — 6 tests.

- [ ] **Step 6: Type check and commit**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test
git add src/lib/deployment-mode.ts src/lib/deployment-mode.test.ts src/lib/settings.ts
git commit -m "feat: deployment mode setting (local vs connected) with local feature list"
```

---

### Task 2: Local mode at bootstrap

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/lib/business-provisioning.ts` (`ProvisionBusinessInput`, `provisionBusiness`)
- Modify: `src/app/api/setup/bootstrap/route.ts`
- Test: covered by `integration/pairing.integration.test.ts` in Task 7 (this file is DB-touching, so per repo convention it has no direct unit test)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `DeploymentModeName`, `LOCAL_DISABLED_FEATURES` from `./deployment-mode`; `SETTING_KEYS` from `./settings`.
- Produces: `ProvisionBusinessInput.deploymentMode?: DeploymentModeName`, defaulting to `"connected"` when absent.

---

- [ ] **Step 1: Extend the provisioning input type**

In `src/lib/business-provisioning.ts`, add the import at the top (after the existing `./slug` import):

```ts
import { LOCAL_DISABLED_FEATURES, type DeploymentModeName } from "./deployment-mode";
import { SETTING_KEYS } from "./settings";
```

Then add to `ProvisionBusinessInput`, after `seedChartOfAccounts`:

```ts
  /**
   * How this install relates to the online platform. 'local' stamps the
   * deployment-mode setting and seeds `business_features` overrides turning
   * off everything that needs the platform to work (see
   * LOCAL_DISABLED_FEATURES). Absent means 'connected', which writes nothing
   * — so every existing caller (the online console, public signup) is
   * unchanged.
   */
  deploymentMode?: DeploymentModeName;
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the local-mode seeding inside the provisioning transaction**

In `src/lib/business-provisioning.ts`, in `provisionBusiness`, immediately after the `if (input.seedChartOfAccounts) { … }` block and before `await client.query("COMMIT")`:

```ts
      // Local-only installs record the mode and turn off the platform-dependent
      // features in the same transaction that creates the business, so there is
      // never a window where a local install looks like a connected one.
      if (input.deploymentMode === "local") {
        await client.query(
          `INSERT INTO settings (business_id, location_id, key, value)
           VALUES ($1, NULL, $2, $3)`,
          [businessId, SETTING_KEYS.deploymentMode, JSON.stringify({ mode: "local", pairedAt: null })],
        );
        for (const flagKey of LOCAL_DISABLED_FEATURES) {
          await client.query(
            `INSERT INTO business_features (business_id, flag_key, enabled)
             SELECT $1, $2, false
              WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM feature_flags WHERE key = $2)
             ON CONFLICT (business_id, flag_key) DO UPDATE SET enabled = false, updated_at = now()`,
            [businessId, flagKey],
          );
        }
      }
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Accept the field in the bootstrap route**

In `src/app/api/setup/bootstrap/route.ts`, replace:

```ts
  let created;
  try {
    created = await provisionBusiness(input);
```

with:

```ts
  // The first-run wizard's mode choice. Anything other than the literal
  // 'local' is treated as connected, which is what every non-desktop caller
  // (public signup, the platform console) already sends by omission.
  const deploymentMode =
    (body as { deploymentMode?: unknown }).deploymentMode === "local" ? "local" : "connected";

  let created;
  try {
    created = await provisionBusiness({ ...input, deploymentMode });
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Type check**

Run: `npx tsc --noEmit`
Expected: no errors.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the existing test suites to prove nothing regressed**

```bash
npm test
npm run test:db
```
Expected: PASS. `provisionBusiness` without `deploymentMode` behaves exactly as before, so every existing caller and test is untouched.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/lib/business-provisioning.ts src/app/api/setup/bootstrap/route.ts
git commit -m "feat: bootstrap can provision a local-only business with platform features off"
```

---

### Task 3: Pairing codes — table and pure logic

**Files:**
- Create: `migrations/0048_install_pairing_codes.sql`
- Create: `src/lib/pairing-codes.ts`
- Create: `src/lib/pairing-codes.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing from earlier tasks.
- Produces:
  - `const PAIRING_CODE_ALPHABET: string`
  - `const PAIRING_CODE_TTL_HOURS = 72`
  - `function generatePairingCode(): string` — formatted `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`
  - `function normalizePairingCode(raw: string): string` — 12 chars, no dashes
  - `function hashPairingCode(code: string): string` — sha-256 hex of the normalised code
  - `type PairingCodeState = "valid" | "code_expired" | "code_already_redeemed" | "code_revoked"`
  - `interface PairingCodeRow { expiresAt: Date; redeemedAt: Date | null; revokedAt: Date | null }`
  - `function pairingCodeState(row: PairingCodeRow, now: Date): PairingCodeState`

---

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the migration**

Create `migrations/0048_install_pairing_codes.sql`:

```sql
-- ============================================================================
-- 0048_install_pairing_codes.sql — desktop first-run pairing
--
-- A pairing code is how a desktop install claims an existing business that was
-- provisioned on the online platform. An operator issues one from the
-- super-admin console and hands it to the owner out-of-band; redeeming it
-- returns a one-time snapshot of the business configuration, which the local
-- install replays into its empty database.
--
-- Only the code's sha-256 is stored, following the same rule as the Phase 13
-- invitations and the Phase 9 rollup tokens: the plaintext is shown once at
-- creation and is unrecoverable afterwards, so a database read can never yield
-- a usable code.
-- ============================================================================

CREATE TABLE install_pairing_codes (
    id           uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    business_id  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES businesses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    location_id  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES locations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    code_hash    text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    expires_at   timestamptz NOT NULL,
    issued_by    uuid REFERENCES platform_users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    redeemed_at  timestamptz,
    redeemed_ip  inet,
    revoked_at   timestamptz,
    created_at   timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_pairing_codes_business ON install_pairing_codes (business_id, created_at DESC);

-- At most one live code per business: re-issuing should replace the pending
-- code, not accumulate several that all still work.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_pairing_codes_live_business
    ON install_pairing_codes (business_id)
    WHERE redeemed_at IS NULL AND revoked_at IS NULL;

-- Phase 12 rule: a new tenant-scoped table needs its policy in the same
-- migration that creates it (see CLAUDE.md). install_pairing_codes carries
-- business_id, so it takes the standard shape.
ALTER TABLE install_pairing_codes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE install_pairing_codes FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON install_pairing_codes FOR ALL
    USING (app_rls_bypass() OR business_id = app_current_business())
    WITH CHECK (app_rls_bypass() OR business_id = app_current_business());
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Apply the migration twice to prove reruns are a no-op**

```bash
docker compose up -d
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:migrate
```
Expected: the first run applies `0048_install_pairing_codes`, the second reports nothing to do.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the failing test**

Create `src/lib/pairing-codes.test.ts`:

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test to verify it fails**

Run: `npx vitest run src/lib/pairing-codes.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `Failed to resolve import "./pairing-codes"`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Write the implementation**

Create `src/lib/pairing-codes.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * One-time pairing codes — the credential a desktop install presents to claim
 * an existing online business.
 *
 * Pure by design (only node:crypto), so it is unit-tested directly; the
 * database side lives in pairing-service.ts.

 * The alphabet excludes O/0 and I/1 because a code's whole job is to survive
 * being read aloud over the phone and typed by someone who is not a

 * matches the "O" that was issued.

### Task 4: Snapshot shape and validation

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/pairing-snapshot.ts`
- Create: `src/lib/pairing-snapshot.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**

- Produces:
  - `const PAIRING_SNAPSHOT_VERSION = 1`

### Task 5: Pairing service — issue, list, revoke, redeem, build snapshot

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/pairing-service.ts`
- Modify: `src/lib/db.ts` (the `withoutTenantScope` doc comment, around lines 118–148)
- Test: `integration/pairing.integration.test.ts` in Task 7

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `generatePairingCode`, `hashPairingCode`, `pairingCodeState`, `PAIRING_CODE_TTL_HOURS` from `./pairing-codes`; `PairingSnapshot`, `PAIRING_SNAPSHOT_VERSION` from `./pairing-snapshot`; `query`, `getPool`, `withoutTenantScope` from `./db`; `effectiveFeatures` from `./features`; `setServerSyncConfig` from `./server-sync`; `SETTING_KEYS` from `./settings`.
- Produces:
  - `interface PairingCodeSummary { id: string; businessId: string; locationId: string; expiresAt: string; redeemedAt: string | null; revokedAt: string | null; createdAt: string; state: PairingCodeState }`
  - `async function issuePairingCode(businessId: string, issuedBy: string): Promise<{ code: string; summary: PairingCodeSummary } | { error: "no_location" }>`
  - `async function listPairingCodes(businessId: string): Promise<PairingCodeSummary[]>`
  - `async function revokePairingCode(businessId: string, codeId: string): Promise<boolean>`
  - `type RedeemResult = { ok: true; snapshot: PairingSnapshot } | { ok: false; error: "code_not_found" | "code_expired" | "code_already_redeemed" | "code_revoked" }`
  - `async function redeemPairingCode(rawCode: string, clientIp: string | null): Promise<RedeemResult>`

---

- [ ] **Step 1: Extend the `withoutTenantScope` doc comment**

In `src/lib/db.ts`, in the doc comment above `withoutTenantScope`, add a bullet after the `employee-session-auth` one:

```
 *   - **pairing-redeem** — resolving a one-time desktop pairing code to the
 *     business it was issued for (and reading that business's configuration to
 *     build the snapshot) happens before any tenant has been chosen, the same
 *     identify-the-tenant-first shape as server-sync-auth. Its counterpart on
 *     the local install, `applyPairingSnapshot`, runs under **platform** for
 *     the same reason `provisionBusiness` does: it creates the tenant that
 *     scoping would otherwise require to already exist.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the service**

Create `src/lib/pairing-service.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * The online server's half of desktop pairing: issuing codes from the
 * super-admin console, and trading a redeemed code for a snapshot of the
 * business configuration.
 *
 * DB-touching, so per repo convention it has no direct unit test — the pure
 * logic it leans on is covered by pairing-codes.test.ts and
 * pairing-snapshot.test.ts, and the transactional behaviour by
 * integration/pairing.integration.test.ts.

Run: `npx tsc --noEmit`
Expected: no errors. (`SNAPSHOT_SETTING_KEYS` is a `const` declared after use inside a function body — that is fine at runtime because `buildPairingSnapshot` is only ever called after module evaluation.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

git add src/lib/pairing-service.ts src/lib/db.ts
git commit -m "feat: pairing service — issue, list, revoke, redeem, build snapshot"

### Task 6: Applying a snapshot on the local install

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/pairing-apply.ts`
- Test: `integration/pairing.integration.test.ts` in Task 7

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `PairingSnapshot` from `./pairing-snapshot`; `getPool`, `withoutTenantScope` from `./db`; `SETTING_KEYS` from `./settings`.
- Produces:
  - `interface AppliedSnapshot { businessId: string; businessSlug: string; locationId: string; ownerUserId: string; ownerName: string; ownerPlatformUserId: string | null }`
  - `async function applyPairingSnapshot(snapshot: PairingSnapshot, remoteUrl: string): Promise<AppliedSnapshot>`

---

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the implementation**

Create `src/lib/pairing-apply.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * The local install's half of desktop pairing: replay a PairingSnapshot into
 * an empty database.
 *
 * Bypassed (`platform`) throughout for the same reason `provisionBusiness` is:
 * it creates the tenant that scoping would otherwise require to already
 * exist. One transaction, so a partial pairing is impossible — either the
 * whole business lands or the database stays empty and the owner can retry
 * with a fresh code.
 *
 * Every id is inserted verbatim from the snapshot. That is the point: the
 * laptop and the server share a business_id, location_id and user ids, which
 * is what makes Phase 11's sync_events replay in both directions afterwards.
 *
 * DB-touching, so per repo convention no direct unit test — see
 * integration/pairing.integration.test.ts.

      [snapshot.business.id, flagKey, enabled],
    );
  }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm the sync-token hash matches what the server computes**

`src/lib/server-sync.ts`'s private `hashSyncToken` is `createHash("sha256").update(token).digest("hex")`. Read it and confirm the inline hash above is byte-identical:

Run: `grep -n "function hashSyncToken" -A 3 src/lib/server-sync.ts`
Expected: the same sha-256 hex of the raw token, no salt or prefix.

- [ ] **Step 3: Type check and commit**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test
git add src/lib/pairing-apply.ts
git commit -m "feat: apply a pairing snapshot into an empty local database"
```

### Task 7: Integration test for the whole pairing round trip

**Files:**
- Create: `integration/pairing.integration.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `issuePairingCode`, `listPairingCodes`, `revokePairingCode`, `redeemPairingCode` from `../src/lib/pairing-service`; `applyPairingSnapshot` from `../src/lib/pairing-apply`; `validateSnapshot` from `../src/lib/pairing-snapshot`; `provisionBusiness` from `../src/lib/business-provisioning`; `withTenant`, `withoutTenantScope`, `getPool` from `../src/lib/db`.
- Produces: nothing consumed by later tasks.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test**

Create `integration/pairing.integration.test.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * Desktop first-run pairing, end to end against a real database.
 *
 * The online and local halves both run here — the "online" business is
 * provisioned and issues a code; redeeming it produces a snapshot; applying
 * that snapshot into a *second* database is the laptop. Two databases is what
 * makes the id-preservation claim testable: the same uuids must land on both
 * sides.

- [ ] **Step 2: Simplify the module-loading helper**

Delete the unused `loadLibs` function from the test file — the per-`describe` dynamic imports with query-string cache busters are what actually give each half its own pool. The file should have no reference to `loadLibs` after this step.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the test**

Run: `npm run test:db -- integration/pairing.integration.test.ts`
Expected: PASS — 2 tests.

If the query-string import trick (`../src/lib/db?local`) does not produce a fresh module instance under the repo's vitest version, replace it with `vi.resetModules()` before each dynamic import block and drop the query strings:

```ts
import { vi } from "vitest";
// ...
vi.resetModules();
process.env.DATABASE_URL = urlFor(localDb);
const localDbLib = await import("../src/lib/db");
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the whole integration suite to prove nothing regressed**

Run: `npm run test:db`
Expected: PASS, including `tenant-isolation.integration.test.ts` (which sees the new table).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add integration/pairing.integration.test.ts
git commit -m "test: end-to-end pairing round trip across two databases"
```

### Task 8: Platform API routes for pairing

**Files:**
- Create: `src/app/api/platform/pairing/route.ts`
- Create: `src/app/api/platform/pairing/redeem/route.ts`
- Modify: `src/middleware.ts` (`PLATFORM_PUBLIC_PATHS`, around line 57)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `issuePairingCode`, `listPairingCodes`, `revokePairingCode`, `redeemPairingCode`, `type PairingCodeSummary` from `@/lib/pairing-service`; `requirePlatformCapability`, `withPlatformScope`, `platformAudit` from `@/lib/platform-auth`; `getBusiness` from `@/lib/platform-service`.
- Produces:
  - `GET /api/platform/pairing?businessId=<uuid>` → `{ codes: PairingCodeSummary[] }`
  - `POST /api/platform/pairing` body `{ businessId }` → `{ code: string; summary: PairingCodeSummary }`
  - `DELETE /api/platform/pairing` body `{ businessId, codeId }` → `{ ok: true }`
  - `POST /api/platform/pairing/redeem` body `{ code }` → `{ snapshot: PairingSnapshot }` or `{ error }` with 404/410/409

---

- [ ] **Step 0: Confirm the business-lookup helper's name**

Run: `grep -n "^export async function\|^export function" src/lib/platform-service.ts`

Expected: a function that fetches one business by id. The routes below call it `getBusiness(id)` and treat a falsy return as "not found". If the real name differs (e.g. `getBusinessDetail`, `businessById`), use the real one and keep the same falsy-means-404 handling. If no such helper exists, replace the two `getBusiness(...)` guards with an inline check:

```ts
const { rows } = await query<{ id: string }>(`SELECT id FROM businesses WHERE id = $1`, [businessId]);
if (rows.length === 0) return NextResponse.json({ error: "not_found" }, { status: 404 });
```

(importing `query` from `@/lib/db` — this runs inside `withPlatformScope`, so it is already bypassed).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the console route**

Create `src/app/api/platform/pairing/route.ts`:

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import {
  platformAudit,
  requirePlatformCapability,
  withPlatformScope,
} from "@/lib/platform-auth";
import { getBusiness } from "@/lib/platform-service";
import { issuePairingCode, listPairingCodes, revokePairingCode } from "@/lib/pairing-service";

/**
 * Desktop pairing codes for one business.
 *
 * Guarded on `business.provision` (owner-only) rather than a read capability
 * even for the list: a code's existence and expiry are operational secrets,
 * and the only reason to look at the list is to decide whether to issue or
 * revoke one.
 */
export const GET = withPlatformScope(async (request: NextRequest) => {
  const { error } = await requirePlatformCapability("business.provision");
  if (error) return error;

  const businessId = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get("businessId");
  if (!businessId) return NextResponse.json({ error: "missing_fields" }, { status: 400 });
  if (!(await getBusiness(businessId))) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "not_found" }, { status: 404 });
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ codes: await listPairingCodes(businessId) });
});

/** Issue a code. The plaintext is in this response and nowhere else, ever again. */
export const POST = withPlatformScope(async (request: NextRequest) => {
  const { session, error } = await requirePlatformCapability("business.provision");
  if (error) return error;

  let body: { businessId?: string };
  try {
    body = await request.json();
  } catch {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "bad_request" }, { status: 400 });
  }

  const businessId = body.businessId?.trim();
  if (!businessId) return NextResponse.json({ error: "missing_fields" }, { status: 400 });
  if (!(await getBusiness(businessId))) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "not_found" }, { status: 404 });
  }

  const issued = await issuePairingCode(businessId, session.padmin);
  if ("error" in issued) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: issued.error }, { status: 409 });
  }

  await platformAudit({
    adminId: session.padmin,
    businessId,
    action: "pairing.issue",
    entity: "install_pairing_code",
    entityId: issued.summary.id,
    // Deliberately no code, not even a prefix: the audit log is readable by
    // every admin, and the plaintext is a credential.
    payload: { expiresAt: issued.summary.expiresAt },
  });

  return NextResponse.json({ code: issued.code, summary: issued.summary });
});

export const DELETE = withPlatformScope(async (request: NextRequest) => {
  const { session, error } = await requirePlatformCapability("business.provision");
  if (error) return error;

  let body: { businessId?: string; codeId?: string };
  try {
    body = await request.json();
  } catch {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "bad_request" }, { status: 400 });
  }

  const businessId = body.businessId?.trim();
  const codeId = body.codeId?.trim();
  if (!businessId || !codeId) return NextResponse.json({ error: "missing_fields" }, { status: 400 });

  const revoked = await revokePairingCode(businessId, codeId);
  if (!revoked) return NextResponse.json({ error: "not_found" }, { status: 404 });

  await platformAudit({
    adminId: session.padmin,
    businessId,
    action: "pairing.revoke",
    entity: "install_pairing_code",
    entityId: codeId,
  });

  return NextResponse.json({ ok: true });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the redeem route**

Create `src/app/api/platform/pairing/redeem/route.ts`:

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { redeemPairingCode } from "@/lib/pairing-service";

/**
 * Trade a pairing code for a business snapshot.
 *
 * Public by necessity: the caller is a freshly-installed desktop app with no
 * session in either realm, and the code *is* the credential — the same shape
 * as /api/auth/accept-invite and the server-sync bearer routes. It lives under
 * /api/platform because the issuing side is the platform console, not because
 * it needs a platform session.
 *
 * The response carries the business's whole configuration including credential
 * hashes, so it must never be cached or logged.
 */
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  let body: { code?: string };
  try {
    body = await request.json();
  } catch {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "bad_request" }, { status: 400 });
  }

  const code = body.code?.trim();
  if (!code) return NextResponse.json({ error: "missing_fields" }, { status: 400 });

  const forwarded = request.headers.get("x-forwarded-for");
  const clientIp = forwarded ? forwarded.split(",")[0].trim() : request.headers.get("x-real-ip");

  const result = await redeemPairingCode(code, clientIp);
  if (!result.ok) {
    const status = {
      code_not_found: 404,
      code_expired: 410,
      code_already_redeemed: 409,
      code_revoked: 410,
    }[result.error];
    return NextResponse.json({ error: result.error }, { status });
  }

  const response = NextResponse.json({ snapshot: result.snapshot });
  response.headers.set("Cache-Control", "no-store");
  return response;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Make the redeem route reachable**

In `src/middleware.ts`, extend `PLATFORM_PUBLIC_PATHS`:

```ts
const PLATFORM_PUBLIC_PATHS = [
  "/platform/login",
  "/api/platform/auth/login",
  "/api/platform/auth/logout",
  "/api/platform/auth/me",
  // Desktop pairing: the caller is a freshly-installed app with no session in
  // either realm, and the one-time code in the body is the credential — the
  // same shape as accept-invite. The handler resolves it or refuses.
  "/api/platform/pairing/redeem",
];
```

Note: this entry is redundant with the `pathname.startsWith("/api/platform")` pass-through immediately below it, which already lets every platform API route self-guard. It is listed anyway so the file states the intent explicitly rather than relying on that branch's continued existence.

- [ ] **Step 4: Rate-limit the redeem route against code guessing**

Also in `src/middleware.ts`, **append** two entries to `AUTH_RATE_LIMITED_PATHS` — insert after the existing `"/api/platform/auth/login",` line, leaving every existing entry and its comments intact:

```ts
  // A pairing code is a 12-character credential submitted without a session,
  // and /api/setup/pair forwards one; both belong in the same per-IP bucket as
  // every other credential exchange rather than going unlimited.
  "/api/platform/pairing/redeem",
  "/api/setup/pair",
```

Note `AUTH_RATE_LIMITED_PATHS` is matched with `.includes(pathname)` — exact equality — so both entries must be the full paths above, not prefixes.

- [ ] **Step 5: Type check and build**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
```
Expected: both clean. The build proves the new route files are valid App Router modules.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/app/api/platform/pairing src/middleware.ts
git commit -m "feat: platform API for issuing, revoking and redeeming pairing codes"
```

---

### Task 9: The local pairing route

**Files:**
- Create: `src/app/api/setup/pair/route.ts`
- Modify: `src/middleware.ts` (`PUBLIC_PATHS`, around line 23)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `validateSnapshot` from `@/lib/pairing-snapshot`; `applyPairingSnapshot` from `@/lib/pairing-apply`; `hasAnyUser` from `@/lib/setup-state`; `signSession`, `SESSION_COOKIE`, `sessionCookieOptions` from `@/lib/auth`.
- Produces: `POST /api/setup/pair` body `{ remoteUrl, code }` → `{ ok: true; slug: string }`, or `{ error }` with one of `already_initialized` (409), `missing_fields` (400), `invalid_url` (400), `remote_unreachable` (502), `snapshot_invalid` (502), or the four `code_*` codes passed through from the remote with their status.

---

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the route**

Create `src/app/api/setup/pair/route.ts`:

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

import { validateSnapshot } from "@/lib/pairing-snapshot";
import { hasAnyUser } from "@/lib/setup-state";

/** How long to wait on the online server before calling it unreachable. */
const REDEEM_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000;

const PASSTHROUGH_ERRORS = new Set([
  "code_not_found",
  "code_expired",
  "code_already_redeemed",
  "code_revoked",
]);

/**

 *

 * carries credential hashes, and routing it through the browser would put them
 * in a place they have no business being.
 */
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  if (await hasAnyUser()) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "already_initialized" }, { status: 409 });
  }

  let body: { remoteUrl?: string; code?: string };

  // fast rejection, but the redeem round trip above takes seconds, and
  // applying into a non-empty database would violate the primary keys the
  // snapshot carries.
  if (await hasAnyUser()) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "already_initialized" }, { status: 409 });
  }

  const applied = await applyPairingSnapshot(validation.snapshot, remoteUrl);

  const token = await signSession({
    sub: applied.ownerUserId,
    role: "owner",
    businessId: applied.businessId,
    businessSlug: applied.businessSlug,
    locationId: null,
    fullName: applied.ownerName,
    platformUserId: applied.ownerPlatformUserId,
  });
  const response = NextResponse.json({ ok: true, slug: applied.businessSlug });
  response.cookies.set(SESSION_COOKIE, token, sessionCookieOptions());
  return response;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm the `signSession` payload shape matches**

Run: `grep -n "export async function signSession" -A 14 src/lib/auth.ts`
Expected: a payload accepting `sub`, `role`, `businessId`, `businessSlug`, `locationId`, `fullName`, `platformUserId` — the same fields `src/app/api/setup/bootstrap/route.ts:48-56` passes. If `platformUserId` is typed as `string` rather than `string | null`, pass `applied.ownerPlatformUserId ?? undefined`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Make the route reachable**

In `src/middleware.ts`, extend `PUBLIC_PATHS` right after `"/api/setup/state",`:

```ts
  // Desktop first-run pairing: like bootstrap, it runs against an empty
  // database, so there is no session to require. The one-time code in the body
  // is the credential, and the route refuses once any user exists.
  "/api/setup/pair",
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Type check and build**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
```
Expected: both clean.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/app/api/setup/pair src/middleware.ts
git commit -m "feat: local first-run pairing route redeems a code and seeds the install"
```

### Task 10: The three-state welcome wizard

**Files:**
- Create: `src/app/welcome/mode-choice.tsx`
- Create: `src/app/welcome/pair-form.tsx`
- Modify: `src/app/welcome/page.tsx` (whole file)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `POST /api/setup/bootstrap` with `{ businessName, locationName, ownerName, email, password, deploymentMode: "local" }`; `POST /api/setup/pair` with `{ remoteUrl, code }`.
- Produces: nothing consumed by later tasks.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the mode-choice screen**

Create `src/app/welcome/mode-choice.tsx`:

```tsx
"use client";

/**
 * First screen of the desktop first-run wizard: local-only, or claim an
 * existing online business.
 *
 * Two cards rather than a dropdown, because this is a decision the owner makes
 * once and cannot change afterwards — it deserves the space to say what each
 * option costs.
 */

  return (
    <div className="w-full max-w-3xl">

- [ ] **Step 5: Manual smoke test**

```bash
docker compose up -d
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/welcome` against an **empty** database (drop and re-migrate if needed). Verify:
1. Two cards appear.
2. «راه‌اندازی محلی» shows the bootstrap form; the back arrow returns to the cards.
3. Submitting it lands on `/setup/business`.
4. On a fresh empty database, «اتصال به پلتفرم آنلاین» with a bogus code shows «کد اتصال معتبر نیست.» (pointing `remoteUrl` at a server that has a business and a real code is exercised by the integration test).

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/app/welcome
git commit -m "feat: three-state first-run wizard — choose local setup or online pairing"
```

### Task 11: Platform console pairing panel

**Files:**
- Create: `src/app/platform/businesses/[id]/pairing-panel.tsx`
- Modify: `src/app/platform/businesses/[id]/page.tsx` (import + mount after `<FeaturesPanel />`)
- Modify: `src/app/platform/ui.tsx` (`errorMessage` map)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `api`, `errorMessage`, `Button`, `Card`, `ErrorBox`, `InfoBox`, `useCan` from `../../ui`; the routes from Task 8.
- Produces: nothing consumed by later tasks.

---

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the new error codes to the console vocabulary**

In `src/app/platform/ui.tsx`, inside `errorMessage`'s `map`, after the `delete_failed` line:

```ts
    no_location: "این کسب‌وکار هنوز شعبه‌ای ندارد؛ ابتدا یک شعبه بسازید.",
    code_not_found: "کد اتصال پیدا نشد.",
    code_expired: "این کد منقضی شده است.",
    code_already_redeemed: "این کد قبلاً استفاده شده است.",
    code_revoked: "این کد لغو شده است.",
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the panel**

Create `src/app/platform/businesses/[id]/pairing-panel.tsx`:

```tsx
"use client";

/**
 * Desktop pairing codes for one business.
 *
 * The plaintext code exists only in the response to the issue request — this
 * component holds it in state so the operator can copy it, and it is gone on
 * the next render pass. Re-issuing revokes whatever was live, so the list
 * never shows two usable codes.

- [ ] **Step 3: Mount it in the business detail page**

In `src/app/platform/businesses/[id]/page.tsx`, add the import after the `../../ui` import block:

```ts
import { PairingPanel } from "./pairing-panel";
```

and mount it between `<FeaturesPanel />` and `<ImpersonationPanel />`:

```tsx
      <FeaturesPanel key={`features-${resetKey}`} id={id} />
      <PairingPanel key={`pairing-${resetKey}`} id={id} />
      <ImpersonationPanel key={`impersonation-${resetKey}`} id={id} businessName={business.name} />
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Type check and build**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
```
Expected: both clean.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add "src/app/platform/businesses/[id]" src/app/platform/ui.tsx
git commit -m "feat: platform console panel for issuing and revoking pairing codes"
```

### Task 12: Local-mode backup — wizard step, cloud lockout, Electron folder picker

**Files:**
- Create: `src/app/setup/backup/page.tsx`
- Modify: `src/lib/setup-state.ts` (`WIZARD_STEPS`, `OPTIONAL_STEPS`, `SetupState`, `computeSetupState`)
- Modify: `src/app/setup/steps.ts`
- Modify: `src/app/api/backup/config/route.ts`
- Modify: `src/app/dashboard/backup/backup-manager.tsx`
- Modify: `electron/preload.js`
- Modify: `electron/main.js`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `isLocalOnly` from `@/lib/deployment-mode`; `getBackupConfigMasked`, `setBackupConfig`, `getBackupConfig` from `@/lib/backup-service`; `validateBackupConfig`, `DEFAULT_BACKUP_CONFIG` from `@/lib/backup`; `markStepDone` from `@/lib/settings`.
- Produces:
  - `window.desktop?.pickFolder(): Promise<string | null>` (declared as a global in `src/app/setup/backup/page.tsx`)
  - `GET /api/backup/config` response gains `localOnly: boolean`
  - `WIZARD_STEPS` gains `"backup"`; `OPTIONAL_STEPS` gains `"backup"`
  - `SetupState` gains `localOnly: boolean`

---

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the wizard step to the shared step lists**

In `src/lib/setup-state.ts`:

```ts
export const WIZARD_STEPS = [
  "business",
  "accounts",
  "costing",
  "tax",
  "users",
  "menu",
  "hardware",
  "backup",
  "opening",
] as const;
```

```ts
/** Steps that may be skipped and still allow finishing the wizard. */
export const OPTIONAL_STEPS: WizardStep[] = ["users", "hardware", "backup", "opening"];
```

Add the import at the top of the file:

```ts
import { isLocalOnly } from "./deployment-mode";
```

Add `localOnly` to `SetupState`, right after `needsBootstrap`:

```ts
  needsBootstrap: boolean;
  /** True on a standalone desktop install: no online platform, local-drive backup only. */
  localOnly: boolean;
```

and populate it in `computeSetupState`. Change the destructured `Promise.all` block:

```ts
  const [prefs, costing, tax, progress, localOnly] = await Promise.all([
    getSetting<BusinessPrefs>(businessId, SETTING_KEYS.businessPrefs),
    getSetting<CostingSetting>(businessId, SETTING_KEYS.costing),
    getSetting<TaxSetting>(businessId, SETTING_KEYS.tax),
    getWizardProgress(businessId),
    isLocalOnly(businessId),
  ]);
```

and the returned object:

```ts
  return {
    needsBootstrap: false,
    localOnly,
    business,
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the step to the wizard's step metadata**

In `src/app/setup/steps.ts`, insert between `hardware` and `opening`:

```ts
  {
    id: "backup",
    path: "/setup/backup",
    title: "مقصد پشتیبان‌گیری",
    short: "پشتیبان",
    optional: true,
  },
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Return `localOnly` from the backup config route and refuse cloud in local mode**

The `GET` replacement below assumes the handler currently returns `{ config: await getBackupConfigMasked(session.businessId) }`. Open the file first and keep whatever it actually calls and whatever other keys it already returns — the only change is adding `localOnly` alongside them.

In `src/app/api/backup/config/route.ts`, replace the `GET` handler:

```ts
export const GET = withTenantScope(async () => {
  const { session, error } = await requireRole("owner");
  if (error) return error;

  return NextResponse.json({
    config: await getBackupConfigMasked(session.businessId),
    // A local-only install has no cloud story: the client hides the whole
    // S3 section, and the PUT below refuses to enable it.
    localOnly: await isLocalOnly(session.businessId),
  });
});
```

and add, inside `PUT`, immediately after the `validated` check:

```ts
  // A standalone install cannot use cloud backup: there is no platform to hold
  // the credentials, and the whole point of local mode is that nothing leaves
  // the machine. The local half of the schedule stays fully available.
  if (validated.config.cloud.enabled && (await isLocalOnly(session.businessId))) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "cloud_backup_unavailable_local" }, { status: 400 });
  }
```

Add the import:

```ts
import { isLocalOnly } from "@/lib/deployment-mode";
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Hide the cloud section in the dashboard backup manager**

Open `src/app/dashboard/backup/backup-manager.tsx`. Find where it fetches `/api/backup/config` and stores the response, and:

1. Add `const [localOnly, setLocalOnly] = useState(false);` alongside the existing state.
2. In the fetch's `.then`, add `setLocalOnly(Boolean(data.localOnly));`.
3. Wrap the JSX block containing the S3/cloud fields (endpoint, region, bucket, prefix, access key, secret, passphrase, cloud retention, and the cloud `enabled` toggle) in `{!localOnly ? ( … ) : null}`.
4. Immediately after that block, add the explanatory note:

```tsx
{localOnly ? (
  <p className="rounded-lg border border-input bg-muted/40 px-4 py-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
    این نصب محلی است؛ پشتیبان‌گیری ابری در دسترس نیست. نسخه‌های پشتیبان روی همین دستگاه
    ساخته و نگهداری می‌شوند.
  </p>
) : null}
```

Also add the error code to whatever error map the file uses (search for `missing_fields` in it):

```ts
cloud_backup_unavailable_local: "در نصب محلی، پشتیبان‌گیری ابری در دسترس نیست.",
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Write the wizard step page**

Create `src/app/setup/backup/page.tsx`:

```tsx
"use client";

/**
 * Optional wizard step, shown only on a local-only install: where the nightly
 * backup is written.
 *
 * On the desktop app the folder picker is a real OS dialog, exposed by the
 * Electron preload bridge; anywhere else (a browser hitting a local server)
 * it degrades to typing the path, which is the only thing a browser can do.

```

- [ ] **Step 4a: Confirm the progress endpoint's contract**

Run: `cat src/app/api/setup/progress/route.ts`
Expected: a `POST` accepting `{ step }` and calling `markStepDone`. If the field is named differently (e.g. `stepId`), change the body in Step 5's `save()` to match. If the route does not exist, look at how another optional step (e.g. `src/app/setup/hardware/page.tsx`) records completion and copy that call verbatim.

- [ ] **Step 4b: Confirm `BackupConfig` carries a directory**

Run: `grep -n "directory\|BACKUP_DIR" src/lib/backup.ts src/lib/backup-service.ts | head -20`

If `BackupConfig` has no `directory` field (the spec's `BackupConfig` listing shows `enabled`, `intervalHours`, `anchorTime`, `localRetention`, `cloud`), then the backup destination is currently an environment variable, not a setting. In that case:

1. Add `directory: string` to `BackupConfig` in `src/lib/backup.ts` with `""` in `DEFAULT_BACKUP_CONFIG` (empty = use today's default location, so nothing changes for existing installs).
2. Accept and validate it in `validateBackupConfig`: reject a non-string; trim; no other constraint (the OS reports a bad path at write time, and pre-validating a Windows path in TypeScript is worse than useless).
3. Add a case to `src/lib/backup.test.ts` proving an absent `directory` defaults to `""` and a supplied one round-trips.
4. In whichever function resolves the output path for a backup artifact, prefer `config.directory` when non-empty over the existing default.

Run: `npx vitest run src/lib/backup.test.ts`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 6: Add the Electron folder picker**

Replace the contents of `electron/preload.js`:

```js
// Bridge between the Electron shell and the web app.
//
// Deliberately minimal and explicitly enumerated: contextIsolation stays on,
// and the renderer gets exactly the native capabilities it needs and nothing
// more. Today that is one thing — a real folder picker for the backup
// destination, which a browser cannot provide.
"use strict";

const { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } = require("electron");

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("desktop", {
  /** Opens the OS folder dialog. Resolves to the chosen absolute path, or null if cancelled. */
  pickFolder: () => ipcRenderer.invoke("pick-folder"),
});
```

In `electron/main.js`, change the top-level require:

```js
const { app, BrowserWindow, dialog, ipcMain } = require("electron");
```

and register the handler inside `app.whenReady().then(...)`, before `await startBackend()`:

```js
app.whenReady().then(async () => {
  // The backup-destination wizard step calls this through the preload bridge;
  // a browser has no way to return a real filesystem path, so the desktop
  // shell is the only place it can come from.
  ipcMain.handle("pick-folder", async () => {
    const { canceled, filePaths } = await dialog.showOpenDialog({
      properties: ["openDirectory", "createDirectory"],
      title: "پوشهٔ پشتیبان‌گیری",
    });
    return canceled ? null : filePaths[0];
  });

  await startBackend();
  await createWindow();
  // ... existing 'activate' handler unchanged
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Full pre-commit verification**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test
npm run test:db
npm run build
```
Expected: all four clean. In particular `npm run test:db` re-runs any test asserting on `computeSetupState`'s shape, which just gained `localOnly`.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add src/app/setup/backup src/lib/setup-state.ts src/app/setup/steps.ts \
        src/app/api/backup/config/route.ts src/app/dashboard/backup/backup-manager.tsx \
        src/lib/backup.ts src/lib/backup.test.ts \
        electron/preload.js electron/main.js
git commit -m "feat: local-mode backup destination step, cloud lockout, Electron folder picker"
```

### Task 13: Documentation

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/standalone-desktop-app.md`
- Modify: `README.md` (the "Multi-business tenancy" section, or wherever deployment modes would naturally be described)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything built above.
- Produces: nothing.

---

- [ ] **Step 1: Document the first-run flow in the desktop doc**

Add a section to `docs/standalone-desktop-app.md`:

```markdown
## First run — local setup or pairing

The first time the desktop app opens against an empty database it shows a choice
rather than a form:

**راه‌اندازی محلی** — a brand-new business that lives only on this machine. It
runs the same bootstrap the web app has always used, then stamps
`settings['deployment.mode'] = { mode: 'local', pairedAt: null }` and writes
`business_features` "off" overrides for `ai_assistant`, `multi_location` and
`offline_mode` (see `src/lib/deployment-mode.ts`). Everything else — sales,
menu, inventory, ledger, reporting, local-drive backup — works unchanged. The
setup wizard then gains one extra optional step, «مقصد پشتیبان‌گیری», where the
owner picks a backup folder through a real OS dialog (`window.desktop.pickFolder`,
exposed by `electron/preload.js`).

**اتصال به پلتفرم آنلاین** — claim a business that already exists on the online
platform. An operator issues a one-time pairing code from the super-admin
console (`/platform` → the business → «کد اتصال نصب دسکتاپ»), hands it to the
owner out-of-band, and the owner types it here along with the server URL. The
local server calls `POST <remoteUrl>/api/platform/pairing/redeem`, which marks
the code redeemed and returns a `PairingSnapshot`: the business, its branch, its
members (with their bcrypt PIN/password hashes, so staff sign in with the
credentials they already have), the chart of accounts, the menu, the
configuration settings, the effective feature flags, and a freshly-minted
server-sync token. `applyPairingSnapshot` replays it into the empty local
database in one transaction, **preserving every id verbatim** — the laptop and
the server share a `business_id`, `location_id` and user ids, which is what
makes Phase 11's `sync_events` replay correctly in both directions.

A pairing code is valid for 72 hours, is single-use, and only its sha-256 is
stored — the plaintext appears once in the console and is unrecoverable
afterwards. Re-issuing revokes whatever code was live; the partial unique index
`idx_pairing_codes_live_business` enforces at most one.

The mode is chosen once and is not changeable from the UI. Upgrading a local
install to a connected one means merging two datasets, which is deliberately out
of scope.

Add near the tenancy section of `README.md`:

```markdown
### Deployment mode

`settings['deployment.mode']` records whether an install is `local` (standalone
desktop, no online platform) or `connected`. **An absent setting reads as
`connected`**, so every deployment that predates this feature — every VPS, every
already-paired laptop — behaves exactly as it did, with no backfill migration.
`isLocalOnly(businessId)` in `src/lib/deployment-mode.ts` is the one place to
ask.

## Summary

A fresh Electron desktop install now asks how it should be set up instead of
dropping straight into a bootstrap form:

- **راه‌اندازی محلی** — a new standalone business. Records `deployment.mode = local`
  and turns off the three platform-dependent features (`ai_assistant`,
  `multi_location`, `offline_mode`). Gains one optional wizard step for the
  local backup destination, with a real OS folder picker on the desktop.
- **اتصال به پلتفرم آنلاین** — claim an existing online business with a one-time
  pairing code issued from the super-admin console. The local server redeems the
  code, receives a full configuration snapshot, and replays it into its empty
  database preserving every id, so server-sync works afterwards.

## Notes

- New table `install_pairing_codes` with its RLS policy in the same migration
  (0048), following the `invitations` pattern: only the sha-256 is stored, the
  plaintext is shown once.
- Two new `withoutTenantScope` calls, both fitting existing justified reasons —
  `redeemPairingCode` (resolve a bearer credential to its business, the
  server-sync-auth shape) and `applyPairingSnapshot` (creates the tenant, the
  provisionBusiness shape). Documented in `src/lib/db.ts`.
- An absent `deployment.mode` reads as `connected`, so every existing install is
  unaffected with no backfill.

## Testing

- `src/lib/pairing-codes.test.ts`, `src/lib/pairing-snapshot.test.ts`,
  `src/lib/deployment-mode.test.ts` — pure logic.
- `integration/pairing.integration.test.ts` — issue → redeem → apply across two
  real databases, proving id preservation and single-use enforcement.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test`, `npm run test:db`, `npm run build` all pass.

**Deviations from the spec, deliberate:**

1. The spec named `requirePlatformCapability("businesses:write")`. That capability does not exist — `PlatformCapability` in `src/lib/platform-admin.ts` uses dot-separated names. The plan uses `business.provision` (owner-only), which matches the risk of handing out a credential that yields a whole business's configuration.
2. The spec's snapshot `users` entry had no platform-identity fields. Without them the owner could not sign in on the laptop with their platform email and password (`users.password_hash` may legitimately be null when the credential lives on `platform_users`). The plan carries `platformUserEmail`, `platformUserFullName` and `platformUserPasswordHash`.
3. The spec's snapshot had no `version`. `validateSnapshot` is described as a "shape/version check", so `PAIRING_SNAPSHOT_VERSION` is part of the payload and a mismatch fails closed.
4. The plan adds `POST /api/setup/pair` and `POST /api/platform/pairing/redeem` to the middleware's per-IP auth rate-limit bucket. A 12-character code with no session is a credential exchange and belongs there; the spec did not say so, but omitting it would leave the only brute-forceable surface in this feature unprotected.
5. Task 12 Step 4b makes the `BackupConfig.directory` field conditional on what is already there. The spec asserted `BackupConfig` "already has the right shape"; the field list it quotes has no directory, so the step verifies and, if needed, adds it — rather than a wizard step that silently saves nothing.
6. The spec named the pure helpers `generateCode()`, `normalizeCode()`, `hashCode()` and `validateRedeemable()`. The plan uses `generatePairingCode()`, `normalizePairingCode()`, `hashPairingCode()` and `pairingCodeState()` — prefixed because these are imported across module boundaries where a bare `hashCode` would read ambiguously next to `hashSyncToken` and `hashKey`, and `pairingCodeState` because it returns *which* failure applies rather than a boolean.

**Verification steps deliberately included:** Task 6 Step 2, Task 8 Step 0, Task 9 Step 2, Task 12 Steps 4a and 4b each confirm a name or shape in existing code before depending on it. These are not placeholders — each states exactly what to run, what to expect, and what to do if the expectation does not hold. They exist because the plan reaches into five subsystems (`server-sync`, `platform-service`, `auth`, `setup/progress`, `backup`) whose exact signatures were not all read at planning time; guessing and being wrong would surface as a type error mid-task rather than a clean decision point.
