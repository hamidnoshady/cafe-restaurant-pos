# Phase A — AI Operating Layer: Real Codebase Audit & Migration Map

> Source of truth: the code and migrations in this repository as of branch

## 0. Executive reality check

This is **not** a greenfield or a thin AI subsystem. The platform already has a
large, mature AI stack that has itself been through ~15 documented "phases"
(18 → 39). Concretely, `src/lib` alone has **640 files**, of which ~70 are
`ai-*`, and there are **182 SQL migrations**, ~30 AI/wallet/media related.

Much of what the brief asks for as "new" is **already partially built**:

- **LiteLLM is already integrated** as a first-class provider and increasingly
  as a control plane (migrations `0121`, `0123`, `0124`, `0125`; the app already
  reads `x-litellm-response-cost` and can price a turn from the gateway's real
  USD cost — see `ai-service.ts:155 responseCostUsd`, `ai-gateway-service.ts:878
  resolveGatewayTurnPricing`).
- Virtual keys, per-business/branch gateway rows, spend refresh, model routing,
  fallbacks, RAG-on-gateway-embeddings, and prompt-management scaffolding all
  exist to varying degrees.

So the work is genuinely an **evolution/consolidation**, exactly as the brief's
"IMPORTANT ENGINEERING PRINCIPLE" states — not a rebuild.

The brief (42 parts, 21 done-criteria) is, realistically, a **multi-month,
multi-engineer program**. It touches billing correctness, tenant isolation,
accounting invariants, a full UI redesign, and destructive schema migration.
Doing it as one blind mega-commit would be reckless. This document defines the
target architecture and a safe, phased, test-backed sequence, and the
implementation proceeds in reviewable increments on this branch.

## 1. What actually exists today (component inventory)

### 1.1 AI runtime & gateway
| File | Role | LiteLLM-aware? |
|---|---|---|
| `src/lib/ai.ts` (57k) | `ACTION_CATALOG`, `ActionType`, prompt assembly, agent modes | — |
| `src/lib/ai-service.ts` (28k) | chat/vision/extract calls, reads `x-litellm-response-cost` | **yes** |
| `src/lib/ai-gateway.ts` (38k) | pure gateway math: `rialFromGatewayUsd`, `gatewayTurnPricing` | **yes** |
| `src/lib/ai-gateway-service.ts` (36k) | LiteLLM mgmt API: `provisionVirtualKey`, `refreshKeySpend`, `probeGateway`, `readProxyRouterSettings`, `listGatewayModels`, `resolveGatewayTurnPricing` | **yes** |
| `src/lib/ai-tools.ts` (61k) | 36 read tools (`READ_TOOL_NAMES`), `runReadTool` | — |
| `src/lib/ai-tool-routing.ts` | which tools a surface may call | — |
| `src/lib/ai-prompts.ts` (19k) | prompt templates (DB-backed, migration `0112`/`0115`) | partial |
| `src/lib/ai-config.ts` | model/temperature config | — |

### 1.2 Billing (the central conflict — Parts 2/3)
Two parallel money systems currently coexist:

1. **AI-specific credit ledger** (`ai_business_billing.balance_rial`,
   `ai_credit_ledger`), driven by **reserve→settle→cancel**:
   - `reserveAiTurn` / `settleAiTurn` / `cancelAiTurnReservation`
     (`ai-billing-service.ts:292/363/444`).
   - Callers: `api/ai/chat/route.ts`, `api/ai/inventory-vision/route.ts`,
     `api/ai/invoice-ocr/route.ts`, `api/media/[id]/detect/route.ts`,
     `ai-autopilot-service.ts`, `ai-proactive-service.ts`.
   - Reservation debits the AI balance up-front (`max_turn_rial`), settles to
     real cost, refunds the remainder. This is exactly the "reserve the maximum
     turn" pattern Part 2 says to retire.
2. **Canonical platform wallet** (`business_wallets`, `wallet_ledger`,
   `wallet-service.ts`), with row-locked `writeLedger`, `chargeFeatureUse`,
   `getWallet`, top-ups & Zarinpal (migration `0130`). Used by media, website,
   billing-service. `featureKey`/`feature_key` column already exists.

**Gap:** AI does **not** debit the canonical wallet. It debits a second balance.
`business_wallets` is referenced by 2 files; `ai_business_billing` by 1
(the AI billing service). This is the duplicate-money-system the brief targets.

### 1.3 Local AI infra that duplicates LiteLLM (Parts 4/5)
| Concern | Local impl | Migration | LiteLLM replacement status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Semantic answer cache | `ai-answer-cache.ts`, `ai_answer_cache` | `0114` | Not yet on gateway; app-owned embedding match |
| Embeddings / RAG | `ai-embeddings.ts`, `ai-rag.ts`, `ai-rag-indexer.ts`, `ai_embeddings` (pgvector) | `0113` | Embeddings already go **through** the gateway alias `pos-embed`; vectors stored locally |
| Per-token pricing | `ai-billing.ts calculateAiUsageCostRial` + `platform_ai_gateway.*_cost_rial_per_million` | `0116`,`0124` | Gateway real cost already available; token rates are the **fallback** |

### 1.4 Entity model (Parts 7–10) — overlap confirmed
- **Automation:** *No dedicated generic automation engine.* The closest is
  `ai_proactive_jobs` (`0040`) + `ai-agents.ts` (5 hard-coded background agent
  keys) + `ai-proactive-service.ts`. Triggers are schedule-only.
- **Coworker:** real subsystem — `ai_coworker_jobs`/`_events`/`_runs` (`0100`),
  `ai-coworker-service.ts` (47k), templates (`ai-coworker-templates.ts` 28k),
  triggers: schedule/event/manual.
- **Agent:** `ai-agents.ts` = 5 fixed keys (`financial_report_builder`,
  `sales_analyzer`, `receivables_follow_up`, `reconciliation_assistant`,
  `service_reminders`) with only `enabled`+`scheduleHour` (migration `0047`).
  **No custom agents, no tool allowlist per agent, no per-agent prompt.**
- **Autopilot:** `ai-autopilot.ts` (guardrail engine — categories, per-category
  Rial limits, `alwaysConfirm`, revertibility), `ai-autopilot-executors.ts`
  (30k), `ai-autopilot-service.ts` (26k). Migration `0097`. **This is the
  valuable safety engine** the brief says to preserve and turn into an
  execution/approval policy.

### 1.5 Projects (Parts 17–20)
`ai_projects` + `ai_project_notes` (`0111`) + `ai_conversations.project_id`.
Columns today: id, business_id, name, instructions, created_by, archived_at.
UI: `(app)/projects/page.tsx`, `(app)/projects/[id]/page.tsx`. This matches the
brief's "too simple" description exactly: name + instructions + notes +
conversation list. **No project memory table, no files, no tasks, no attached
agents/coworkers/automations, no project-native chat.**

### 1.6 Media (Parts 21–23)
`media_assets`/`media_folders` (`0149`), `media-service.ts`, object storage,
`storeMediaAsset`/`readMediaObject`/`deleteMediaAsset`, `ai_status`,
`source_asset_id`/`variant` for AI-refined images. **But AI chat attachments
are deliberately non-persistent** (`ai-attachment.ts`: "nothing here touches a
table or object storage"). So AI uploads/generated files do **not** land in the
Media Library yet — the Part 21 gap.
`media_assets` has no `source`/`conversation_id`/`project_id`/`created_by_ai`
provenance columns yet.

### 1.7 Chat UI (Parts 12–13, 25–28)
- `(app)/ai/page.tsx` → `dashboard/ai/ai-workspace.tsx` (rail + thread +
  composer). Components in `src/components/ai/` (~14). No structured interactive
  cards (single/multi choice, form, entity picker, approval card) as a typed
  protocol — proposals exist via `ai-proposal-card.tsx` but input requests do
  not.

### 1.8 Platform AI admin (Part 33)
`src/app/platform/ai/page.tsx` (805 lines) — super-admin AI console (pricing,
gateway, costing, routing). Candidate for trimming once LiteLLM owns pricing.

### 1.9 Test harness (Part 37) — VERIFIED WORKING
- Unit: `vitest run` (no DB). ✅ ran `ai-billing`+`ai-autopilot` (46 tests pass).
- DB integration: `vitest run --config vitest.db.config.ts`, needs
  `DATABASE_URL`. Embedded Postgres via `scripts/dev-postgres.mjs`
  (`@embedded-postgres/linux-x64`). ✅ verified: `ai-agent-settings.integration`
  passes against local PG on :5433. Existing AI integration tests:
  `ai-gateway`, `ai-coworker`, `ai-conversations`, `ai-autopilot`,
  `ai-virtual-key-provisioning`, `ai-orientation-tools`, `ai-tools-wave13`, etc.

## 2. Capability / gap matrix (business ops vs AI)

Legend: R=read tool exists, A=write action exists (`ACTION_CATALOG`),
C=needs confirm, Auto=can autopilot. Write actions from `ai.ts ActionType`.

| Capability | Manual UI | AI read | AI act (action) | Confirm | Autopilot | Gap / missing tool |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Accounting: reports | ✅ | `list_reports`,`run_report`,`run_accounting_review` | `journal.manual.propose`,`expense.categorize` | ✅ | money | No P&L-explain tool; no reconcile action |
| Accounting: AR/AP | ✅ | `get_ar_aging`,`get_ap_upcoming`,`get_unreconciled_bank_lines` | — | — | — | **No "record payment/allocate receipt" action** |
| Accounting: tax/VAT | ✅ | `get_vat_liability` | `setup.tax` | ✅ | — | No VAT filing prep |
| Sales/POS | ✅ | `get_menu_performance`,`get_void_pattern`,`get_bill_split_preview` | `order.discount.apply` | ✅ | — | No create-order draft |
| Menu/catalog | ✅ | `get_menu_item_details` | `menu.item.*`,`setup.menu.*` | ✅ | pricing | Good coverage |
| Inventory | ✅ | `get_stock_valuation`,`get_near_expiry_items`,`get_waste_history`,`forecast_demand`,`find_items` | `inventory.reorder.draftPO`,`inventory.adjustment.propose`,`inventory.waste.log`,`inventory.production.run` | ✅ | inventory | Good coverage |
| Suppliers | ✅ | `get_supplier_performance` | — | — | — | **No create/update supplier action** |

| Growth/Marketing | ✅ | — | `messaging.campaign.trigger`(coworker-only) | ✅ | messaging | **No campaign create/schedule action; no read tool for campaigns** |
| Website CMS | ✅ | `list_website_posts`,`list_website_products`,`get_website_status` | `website.post.draft/update/publish`,`website.product.upsert` | publish=alwaysConfirm | website | Good coverage |
| WooCommerce | partial | via website tools | website.product.upsert | ✅ | website | Depends on Woo sync; verify |
| Reservations/Tables | ✅ | `get_reservation_conflicts`,`get_table_turnover_rate` | `reservation.create/reschedule`,`table.merge/split`,`courier.assign` | ✅ | — | Good coverage |
| Payroll | ✅ | `get_payroll_summary`,`get_staff_commission` | — | — | — | Read-only (appropriate) |

| Media | ✅ | — | — | — | — | **No AI media tools; uploads not persisted** |
| Team/users | ✅ | — | — | — | — | Intentionally excluded (safety) |

**Highest-value genuine gaps** (Part 16): supplier create/update, customer
create/update, AR receipt/payment allocation, campaign create/schedule +
campaign read tool, project object management, media persistence + media tools.

## 3. LiteLLM capability verification (Part 1 CRITICAL RULE)

Deployed image: `ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:main-stable` (docker-compose.yml).
Config: `docker/litellm/config.yaml`. Before deleting any local impl, each
LiteLLM capability must be verified **against this image's API**, with an
integration test, per the brief. Status of what the app already relies on:

| LiteLLM feature | Used by app today | Verified in tests | Safe to lean on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Virtual keys (`/key/generate`,`/key/info`) | `provisionVirtualKey`,`refreshKeySpend` | `ai-virtual-key-provisioning.integration` | yes |
| Per-response cost header `x-litellm-response-cost` | `responseCostUsd` | `ai-gateway` tests | yes |
| `/spend/logs` rollup | `ai_gateway_usage` | partial | verify before relying for billing |
| Routing/fallbacks/`router_settings` | config + `readProxyRouterSettings` (read-only) | `ai-gateway` | yes (config-owned) |
| Prompt management (dotprompt/`prompt_id`) | scaffolding only, **not wired** | no | **must verify before migrating prompts** |
| Caching (proxy-side) | not used | no | **must verify before deleting `ai_answer_cache`** |
| Managed vector store / RAG | not used (app owns pgvector) | no | **must verify support in this image before moving RAG** |

**Conclusion for Parts 4/5:** The brief's own CRITICAL RULE forbids deleting the
local cache/RAG until the LiteLLM replacement is verified *in this image* and
tested. `main-stable` moves fast; proxy-side caching (Redis) exists, but a
managed vector-store RAG that fully replaces app-owned pgvector + tenant
permission-scoped indexing is **not** something to assume. The safe path:
verify empirically (integration test against a real proxy) first; keep the app
as the owner of *what* content is retrievable (it owns permissions), and only
delegate execution where proven.

## 5. Migration map (safe, additive-first — Part 34)

Every destructive step follows: deploy replacement → migrate data → verify →
stop reads/writes → later drop schema. Nothing is dropped in the same migration
that introduces its replacement.

| # | Change | Type | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | `wallet_ledger.feature_key='ai'` settlement path; `ai_wallet_settlements` metadata table (LiteLLM call id, model, tokens, conv/project/agent ids, cost usd/rial) | additive | wallet-service |
| M2 | Backfill: reconcile `ai_business_billing` → freeze; route all new AI debits to `business_wallets` | data | M1 |
| M3 | `media_assets` provenance columns (`source`, `conversation_id`, `project_id`, `run_id`, `created_by_ai`, `model`) | additive | media |
| M4 | Project workspace tables: `ai_project_memory`, `ai_project_files`(link table), `ai_project_tasks`, `ai_project_members`, entity `project_id` FKs on agents/coworkers/automations | additive | projects |
| M5 | Unified AI entity model: `ai_automations` (trigger/action/conditions), extend agents to custom (`ai_agent_defs` with prompt ref + tool allowlist), coworker prompt refs | additive | — |
| M6 | Prompt bindings: `ai_prompt_bindings` (surface/entity → prompt id + version + scope) | additive | LiteLLM prompt verify |
| M7 | Structured input protocol: `ai_input_requests` (id, run/conv id, type, schema, response, status) | additive | — |
| M8 | (LATE) drop `ai_answer_cache` after LiteLLM cache verified+tested | destructive | Part 4 verify |
| M9 | (LATE) migrate/retire `ai_embeddings` local RAG if/after LiteLLM RAG verified | destructive | Part 5 verify |
| M10 | (LATE) drop `ai_business_billing`/`ai_credit_ledger` after wallet cutover proven | destructive | M2 |

---

## 6. Recommended implementation sequence (matches brief Part 39)

- **B — Wallet cutover (Parts 2/3):** highest correctness value, self-contained,
  testable. Make AI debit the canonical wallet from real LiteLLM cost; retire
  reserve/settle. *Start here.*
- **C — Capability gaps (Part 16):** add supplier/customer/AR/campaign write
  actions + campaign read tool through existing services.
- **D — Unified entity model (Parts 7–10):** Automation engine + custom Agents +
  autopilot-as-policy, preserving the guardrail engine.
- **E — Structured chat protocol (Parts 13/14):** typed input requests + UI cards.
- **F — Projects as workspaces (Parts 17–20):** memory, files, project chat,
  attached objects.
- **G — Media persistence (Parts 21–23).**
- **H — Cache/RAG to LiteLLM (Parts 4/5):** *only after empirical verification.*
- **I — UI redesign + IA (Parts 11/24–28).**
- **J — Cleanup + drop legacy schema (Parts 33/35).**

---

## 6b. Phase B — DELIVERED (wallet billing cutover)

Status: **done, test-backed.** AI turns now bill the canonical
`business_wallets` and the reserve/settle/cancel dance is retired at every live
call site.

What changed:
- **Migration `0153_ai_wallet_billing.sql`** (additive): `feature_flags('ai')`,
  `ai_wallet_settlements` (AI detail + idempotency behind each wallet debit,
  unique on `(business_id, request_id)`), `ai_wallet_debt` (affordability
  backstop). Both new tables are FORCE-RLS tenant-isolated and are
  auto-verified by the generated tenant-isolation suite.
- **`wallet-service.ts`**: `checkAiAffordability` (pre-request gate, pays down
  debt opportunistically), `settleAiWalletCharge` (post-request debit,
  idempotent, partial-debit-into-debt when a real cost can't be covered — never
  negative balance), `getAiDebtRial`, `AI_FEATURE_KEY`. Reuses the existing
  row-locked `withWalletTx`/`writeLedger`, so the no-negative-balance and
  no-double-spend guarantees are unchanged.
- **`ai-wallet-billing.ts`** (new orchestration): `gateAiTurn`,
  `newAiRequestId`, `settleAiTurn`. Prefers LiteLLM's reported USD cost
  (`resolveGatewayTurnPricing`) and falls back to the token rates only when the
  gateway didn't price the turn. Emits `AiWalletInsufficientError`.
- **6 call sites migrated**: `api/ai/chat`, `api/ai/inventory-vision`,
  `api/ai/invoice-ocr`, `api/media/[id]/detect`, `ai-proactive-service`,
  `ai-autopilot-service`. All now gate → run → settle against the wallet; no
  reservation, no refund path (a turn that never reached the provider costs
  nothing).
- **Tests**: `integration/ai-wallet-billing.integration.test.ts` (7 cases:
  real-cost debit, affordability block, idempotency, zero-cost/cache,
  partial→debt→unblock, project attribution, tenant isolation). Existing AI
  suites (autopilot, coworker, conversations, gateway, billing, estimate) still
  green. Full `tsc` clean.

Deliberately **not** done yet (safe migration window, Part 34): the legacy
`ai_business_billing` / `ai_credit_ledger` tables and the now-dead
reserve/settle/cancel functions in `ai-billing-service.ts` remain in place for
reconciliation. They are removed in a later destructive migration (M10) once
the cutover is proven, together with the dead platform AI-subscription code.

## 7. Risks / non-negotiables

- Do not weaken `business_wallets` row-locking / no-negative-balance.
- Do not break accounting posting invariants, RLS, or action audit.
- Do not delete local cache/RAG on faith — verify against `main-stable` first.
- Do not create generic `execute_sql`/`update_table`/`run_javascript` tools.
- Keep both money systems reconciled during the cutover window; never
  double-charge.

## 6c. Phase C — DELIVERED (capability gaps)

Four write actions the assistant was missing, each wired to an **existing**
role-guarded route — no new business logic, no new endpoints — plus the two
read tools that make the campaign write usable.

**New `ACTION_CATALOG` entries** (`src/lib/ai.ts`):

| Action | Endpoint (existing) | Guard | Safety |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `party.customer.create` | `POST /api/parties` (`roles:["Customer"]`) | `parties.view` + `parties.manage` | payload avoids accounting fields, so no `ledger.view` gate |
| `party.supplier.create` | `POST /api/parties` (`roles:["Supplier"]`) | same | same |
| `messaging.campaign.create` | `POST /api/messaging` (`action:"campaign"`) | `requireRole(owner,manager)` | draft only — never launches/sends |
| `ar.receipt.record` | `POST /api/ledger/ar/receipts` | `requireRole(owner,manager,accountant)` | `alwaysConfirm` (moves money) |

- `/api/parties` is the only party write door (migration 0137 removed
  `/api/customers`); customer vs supplier differ only in `roles`, so one
  endpoint serves both catalogue entries. The payload hints deliberately steer
  the model away from accounting fields (`accountingCode`, `taxPercentage`,
  `financial_info`) so the write never trips the route's extra `ledger.view`
  gate — a person's name and phone is the CRM's half, not the ledger's.
- Campaign **create** materialises a draft only. **Launch/send** is
  deliberately *absent* from the catalogue — a message that reaches a real
  person stays a human's click on the growth screen, the same line
  `messaging.campaign.trigger` (coworker-only) already draws.
- None of the four carries an `autopilotCategory` or `executor`: creating a
  person or moving money is a human-confirmed decision, never an unattended
  tick's. They flow through the browser apply path
  (`src/components/ai/apply-proposal.ts`) with the user's own session cookie.
- `ar.receipt.record` is the second `alwaysConfirm` action (after
  `website.post.publish`).

**New read tools** (`src/lib/ai-tools.ts`, `runReadTool` + `READ_TOOL_NAMES`,
MCP summaries in `src/lib/mcp/tools.ts`):

- `list_message_templates` (optional `channel` filter) → `listMessageTemplates`.
- `list_message_campaigns` → `listMessageCampaigns`.
  These give the model a `templateId` (and `segmentId` from the existing
  `list_customer_segments`) before it proposes `messaging.campaign.create`, and
  campaign status for "how did my campaign do" questions.

**Tests**: `src/lib/ai.test.ts` gains a Phase C block (four actions present,
both party creates share `/api/parties`, campaign create is a draft with no
send action, receipt is `alwaysConfirm`, all four out of every unattended
path, both read tools offered in dashboard mode). The `alwaysConfirm` invariant
now pins the two-entry set. `integration/ai-phase-c-tools.integration.test.ts`
exercises both read tools against real rows and asserts per-business scoping.
All 4760 unit tests + AI integration suites (wallet-billing, wave13, phase-c)
green; `tsc` clean.

Deliberately **not** added: `crm.customer.consent`, `crm.customer.merge`,
campaign launch/send — the Phase 36 hard lines still hold (irreversible
promises/judgements about a real person stay a named human's action).

## 6d. Phase D — IN PROGRESS (unified entity model)

Phase D is a three-part program (Parts 7–10): **custom Agents**, a generic
**Automation engine**, and turning **autopilot into a reusable policy**.
Delivered depth-first, one part per turn.

### Part 1 of 3 — Custom Agents — DELIVERED (test-backed)

The sharpest documented gap: until now an "agent" was one of five hard-coded
keys (`ai_agent_settings`, migration 0047) a business could only enable and
reschedule — no custom agents, no per-agent prompt, no per-agent tool
allowlist. This adds a business-defined agent that is a **lens over the same
dashboard assistant**, not a new brain or a new mutation path.

What changed:
- **Migration `0154_ai_custom_agents.sql`** (additive): `ai_custom_agents`
  (name, instructions, `tool_allowlist text[]`, `action_allowlist text[]`,
  enabled, created_by) — FORCE-RLS tenant-isolated, unique name per business,
  auto-verified by the generated tenant-isolation suite. Also widens
  `ai_action_audit.source` to include `'agent'` (joins manual/autopilot/
  coworker) so an agent-produced proposal's later apply is attributable.
- **`ai-custom-agents.ts`** (pure, framework-free): `validateCustomAgent`
  (rejects — never silently drops — an unknown tool/action; a coworker-only
  action is not allowlistable), `selectableAgentTools` (the dashboard read
  surface minus `propose_action`, derived from `toolDefinitions` so it can't
  drift), `selectableAgentActions` (`ACTION_CATALOG` minus coworker-only),
  `agentTurnScope`, `customAgentErrorMessage`.
- **`ai-custom-agents-service.ts`**: CRUD over the table, tenant-scoped,
  unique-name (`23505` → `name_taken`).
- **Runtime wiring — the agent genuinely narrows a turn**:
  - `toolDefinitions("dashboard", { toolAllowlist, actionTypes })` intersects
    the read tools with the allowlist and scopes `propose_action` to the
    agent's action list (empty ⇒ no propose tool at all — a read-only agent).
  - `buildSystemPrompt` appends the agent's instructions **on top of** the
    grounding rules (Persian/Toman/Jalali/never-invent-a-number always stand)
    and scopes the catalogue dump to the agent's actions.
  - `runAgentTurn` accepts `toolAllowlist` and re-checks proposals against the
    scoped action set, so a hand-crafted out-of-scope proposal is refused.
  - `POST /api/ai/chat` accepts `agentId` (dashboard only); a disabled/unknown
    id is a 404, never a silent fallback. An agent turn never shares the
    general assistant's answer cache.
- **Routes**: `GET/POST /api/ai/agents`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/ai/agents/[id]`
  (manager-guarded; GET also returns `selectableTools`/`selectableActions` so a
  future editor renders from the live catalogue).

Tests: `src/lib/ai-custom-agents.test.ts` (13 — validation + that scoping
actually narrows tools/actions/prompt and leaves an un-agented turn unchanged);
`integration/ai-custom-agents.integration.test.ts` (4 — CRUD, unknown-tool
rejection, duplicate-name, cross-tenant not_found). All 4775 unit tests and the
AI integration suites green; `tsc` clean; tenant-isolation suite covers 0154.

A management **UI** is deliberately deferred to Phase I (UI redesign); the REST
API is complete and usable now.

Phase D is now COMPLETE across all three parts (custom Agents, Automation
engine, autopilot-as-policy) — see Parts 1–3 below. Nothing dropped or rewrote
the existing coworker/autopilot schema.

### Part 2 of 3 — Automation engine — DELIVERED (test-backed)

The coworker (0100) fills a fixed TEMPLATE; an automation is a free
composition the owner assembles themselves:

    WHEN  <trigger>      (manual | schedule | event)
    IF    <conditions>   (a typed rule document over run-time facts)
    THEN  <action>       (one ACTION_CATALOG action + payload)

What it adds over everything before it is the **condition** — a typed,
deterministic rule document evaluated against facts read from the database at
fire time. It opens **no new mutation path**: a fired automation proposes
exactly what the chat could, through the same role-guarded executor; the
conditions only decide *whether* to propose.

What changed:
- **Migration `0155_ai_automations.sql`** (additive): `ai_automations`
  (trigger + `conditions jsonb` + `action_type` + `action_payload` +
  ask/auto). Trigger vocabulary and the shape CHECK mirror `ai_coworker_jobs`
  exactly, so one tick can drive both later without a schema change. FORCE-RLS,
  unique name per business, auto-verified by the tenant-isolation suite. Widens
  `ai_action_audit.source` with `'automation'` (now manual/autopilot/coworker/
  agent/automation).
- **`ai-automations.ts`** (pure): a small bounded condition DSL over five
  deterministic facts (`receivableTotalRial`, `payableTotalRial`,
  `stockValuationRial`, `weekday`, `hour`) with `gte`/`lte`/`eq`;
  `evaluateConditions` (empty ⇒ matches, all-of AND any-of); `validateAutomation`
  (rejects — never ignores — an unknown field/operator/action and every
  coworker-only action; enforces the trigger shape); `selectableAutomationActions`.
- **`ai-automations-service.ts`**: tenant-scoped CRUD; `gatherAutomationFacts`
  (reads the same numbers the chat's report tools return — A/R aging total,
  A/P aging total, inventory valuation, business-clock weekday/hour);
  `previewAutomation` (a dry run that reports whether the conditions hold *right
  now* and what it would propose, proposing nothing). `authorized_by` is stored
  only for an `auto` automation.
- **Routes**: `GET/POST /api/ai/automations`, `GET/PUT/DELETE
  /api/ai/automations/[id]`, `GET /api/ai/automations/[id]/preview`
  (manager-guarded; `auto` requires owner; GET list returns the selectable
  fields/operators/event-kinds/actions so a future editor renders from the live
  vocabulary).

Tests: `src/lib/ai-automations.test.ts` (11 — evaluator AND/OR semantics +
validation), `integration/ai-automations.integration.test.ts` (5 — CRUD,
auto authority, unknown-action rejection, real-fact gathering + preview
fires/doesn't-fire, duplicate-name + cross-tenant). All 4789 unit tests + AI
integration suites green; `tsc` clean; tenant-isolation covers 0155.

UI deferred to Phase I; the engine's firing hook (wiring `previewAutomation` +
`gatherAutomationFacts` into the existing coworker/proactive tick to actually
enqueue proposals) lands with **Part 3 — autopilot-as-policy**, which unifies
the ask/auto approval ceiling across coworker, autopilot and automations.

### Part 3 of 3 — autopilot-as-policy + firing hook — DELIVERED (test-backed)

The final Phase D part turns the guardrail engine into ONE named
unattended-execution ceiling shared by every feature that can write without a
person watching, and wires the Automation engine's firing into the existing
tick so a fired automation actually enqueues a proposal on that same guarded
path.

**One named ceiling.** `evaluateUnattendedAction` (in the pure `ai-autopilot.ts`)
is now the single gate every unattended write funnels through — autopilot, the
coworker AND automations. It applies four ordered gates, none of which a
caller's own `approvalMode` can override and none of which is ever a *drop*
(a "no" holds the proposal for a human on the identical manual apply path):
(1) a real action with an unattended executor; (2) the owner chose `auto` for
this work; (3) a real user's authority backs it; (4) the per-category caps admit
this specific payload (delegated to `evaluateAutopilotProposal`, unchanged). The
coworker's `planCoworkerActions` was refactored to a thin adapter over it, so
its four hand-rolled copies of the same reasoning are gone — an owner who set
"money: at most 5,000,000 ﷼ unattended" said that about their *business*, and
there is now exactly one place that rule lives.

**Firing hook.** `ai-automations-service.ts` gained the runtime:
`fireAutomation`/`runAutomationNow`/`runAutomationsTick` plus a claimed
`ai_automation_runs` ledger (migration **0156**, RLS like every tenant table,
`UNIQUE (automation_id, dedupe_key)` mirroring `ai_coworker_runs`). A firing
gathers the same facts `previewAutomation` shows, evaluates the typed
conditions, and only if they hold records the action in the shared
`ai_action_audit` (`source = 'automation'`) and either applies it through the
same `AUTOPILOT_EXECUTORS` (when the shared ceiling admits an `auto`
automation) or leaves it `proposed` with a `deferred_reason` — held, never
dropped, never forced. The daily category counter is shared across
autopilot + coworker + automation, so an automation cannot be a way around the
day's allowance either.

**Riding the tick.** `runBusinessProactiveJobs` now runs `runAutomationsTick`
BEFORE the coworker (the coworker clears the lifecycle-event queue on finish, so
automations must read the unprocessed rows first); its per-event/per-schedule
run claim, not the processed flag, is what keeps it idempotent across ticks.
Like the coworker it uses no provider and spends no credit, needs no opt-in, and
never takes the digests down. A `POST /api/ai/automations/[id]/run` endpoint
fires one on demand (owner required for an `auto` automation).

Tests: `src/lib/ai-autopilot.test.ts` (+6 for `evaluateUnattendedAction`),
`integration/ai-automations.integration.test.ts` (+5 firing: in-cap applies &
audits as `automation` with prior-state; over-cap held as clickable proposal
with the price unmoved; `ask` always held; conditions-not-met ⇒ `skipped`,
proposes nothing; dedupe-key idempotency). Full suite **4796 unit tests / 325
files**; AI integration suites green (automations 10/10, coworker 15/15,
autopilot 10/10, tenant-isolation 20/20 — the last covers 0156); `tsc` clean.

**Phase D COMPLETE** (Parts 1–3: custom Agents, Automation engine,
autopilot-as-policy). UI for all three deferred to Phase I. Next in the agreed
sequence: **Phase E — structured chat input protocol**.

## 6e. Phase E — COMPLETE (structured chat input protocol)

Phase E turns "the AI asks a question" from a free-text guessing game into a
typed round-trip. Instead of the model writing "which supplier — Aram Coffee or
Pak Dairy?" and hoping the human types one back verbatim, it emits a
`request_input` tool call carrying a **spec**, the turn ends (exactly like
`propose_action`), the UI renders a card, and the human's answer is
re-validated server-side against the *stored* spec before it re-enters the
model as plain text.

**Three input kinds** (`src/lib/ai-input-protocol.ts`, the pure validation
core, 15 unit tests):

- `choice` — pick exactly one of N labelled options (optionally an "other"
  free-text escape hatch).
- `multi_choice` — pick zero-or-more, with optional `min`/`max`.
- `form` — a small set of typed fields (`text` / `number`), each
  required-or-not.

`InputRequestSpec` is what the model emits; `InputResponse` is what the human
sends back; `validateInputRequest(spec, response)` is the single gate both the
client (to enable Submit) and the server (as the real authority) run.

**Why `request_input` is read-shaped.** Asking a typed question opens no write
path, so the tool is declared on **every** dashboard turn — including scoped
and read-only custom agents. It is declared LAST in `toolDefinitions`, after
`propose_action`, and the service loop short-circuits on it the same way
(`AgentReply.inputRequest`, `src/lib/ai-service.ts`). Over **MCP** it is
excluded (`EXCLUDED_READ_TOOLS` in `src/lib/mcp/tools.ts`): there is no card
and no human to answer it, so it has no meaning for an external client.

**The answer path never trusts the client.** The card sends back ids
(`{ choice: "s1" }`), but the model is fed **labels**, never ids — the id
"s1" is an implementation detail the model never sees. The answer is
re-validated against the spec that was stored when the request was created, so
a hand-crafted POST naming an option that was never offered is refused
(`invalid_response`). Answering is idempotent: a second submit reports
`already_answered` and does not overwrite the recorded response. A pending
request can be dismissed (`cancelled`).

**Storage & isolation.** `migrations/0157_ai_input_requests.sql` adds
`ai_input_requests`, which reaches tenant scope only through its parent
`ai_conversations` row (the same shape as `ai_messages`) and carries RLS from
it. `src/lib/ai-input-requests-service.ts` is the tenant-scoped DB half
(`createInputRequest`, `answerInputRequest` → returns the model message,
`cancelInputRequest`, plus read helpers). The route
`api/ai/conversations/[id]/input-requests/[requestId]` (POST answer / DELETE
cancel) re-checks `ownsConversation` before doing anything — ownership is the
authorization, the same pattern as the conversation routes (recorded in
`api-guards.test.ts`'s self-guarding list).

**Wiring.** `getConversationMessages` LEFT JOINs the request so a reloaded
conversation shows a still-pending card; `chat/route.ts` creates the row and
includes `inputRequest:{id,spec}|null` on the `done` event, and treats a turn
that asks for input as non-cacheable. Client:
`src/components/ai/use-ai-chat.ts` (`AiInputRequestState`,
`AiChatMessage.inputRequest`, `submitInputRequest`, `dismissInputRequest`),
the new `ai-input-request-card.tsx` (choice / multi_choice / form, with the
"other" escape hatch and client-side `canSubmit`), rendered by
`chat-bubble.tsx` and threaded through `ai-chat-messages.tsx`,
`ai-assistant.tsx`, and `ai-chat-hub.tsx`.

**Tests.** `ai-input-protocol.test.ts` 15/15; the AI unit files that enumerate
tools updated (`request_input` present on dashboard + scoped agents, absent
from MCP read tools, `propose_action` still present); new
`integration/ai-input-requests.integration.test.ts` (create/read pending,
valid answer → label-based model message, refused unknown option, idempotent
double submit, dismiss); `tenant-isolation.integration.test.ts` now covers
0157 (20/20). Full suite **4812 unit tests / 326 files**; `tsc` clean.

**Phase E COMPLETE.** Next in the agreed sequence: **Phase F — Projects as
workspaces (memory / files / project chat).**

## 6f. Phase F — Part 1 DELIVERED (projects become workspaces: live context + memory)

Phase F turns a project from a folder that merely *groups* threads into a
WORKSPACE that *shapes* them. Part 1 closes the gap the audit named in §1.5 and
adds the first new workspace surface.

**The dead-code gap, closed.** `buildProjectPromptContext`,
`getConversationProjectId` and `listConversationsByProject` were all written
"for prompt injection" at Phase 35 Wave 3 and then never called — a project's
standing instruction and notes never reached the model, so a project could not
influence a single reply. Part 1 wires them into the live chat turn:

- `ai-projects.ts` gains `getProjectPromptContext` (loads instruction + notes +
  memory for a business's project in one tenant-scoped pass) and
  `buildProjectPromptContext` now renders the whole `ProjectContext` — project
  NAME, instruction, note titles, and memory — while staying backward
  compatible with its old `(instructions, notes)` signature (existing
  tests/callers unchanged).
- `PromptContext.projectContext` (in `ai.ts`) carries the rendered block;
  `buildSystemPrompt` appends it on dashboard/wizard turns AFTER the grounding
  rules and action catalogue. It INFORMS the assistant; it never widens what the
  assistant may DO — the catalogue is still gated by mode and agent scope.
- `api/ai/chat/route.ts`: accepts `projectId` (used only when a NEW conversation
  is created — resuming keeps the conversation's existing project), resolves the
  conversation's project via `getConversationProjectId`, loads and renders the
  context, and **excludes project-scoped turns from the shared answer cache**
  (a project-shaped answer must not be served to a project-less turn, and vice
  versa) — the same reasoning already applied to agent-scoped turns.
- UI: `useAiChat({ projectId })` sends it on new conversations only;
  `ai-workspace.tsx` and the dashboard `ai-chat-hub.tsx` read `?project=<id>`;
  the project page's Conversations card gains a "چت در این پروژه" link.

**Project memory (new surface).** `migrations/0158_ai_project_memory.sql` adds
`ai_project_memory` — short, standing FACTS the assistant carries for a project
("the owner rounds Toman to the nearest thousand", "this campaign targets lapsed
lunch customers"), distinct from human-authored NOTES. It reaches tenant scope
through its parent `ai_projects` row (same shape as `ai_project_notes`, 0111) and
so is automatically covered by the tenant-isolation suite (20/20). It carries a
`source` column ('user' | 'ai') so AI-authored memory (a Part 2 concern) has a
home without a schema change. Bounds enforced server-side
(`PROJECT_MEMORY_CHAR_LIMIT` 500, `PROJECT_MEMORY_MAX_ENTRIES` 50) so the prompt
context it feeds can never grow without limit. Service:
`addMemory`/`listMemory`/`deleteMemory`. Routes:
`api/ai/projects/[id]/memory` (GET/POST) and `.../memory/[memoryId]` (DELETE),
ownership-as-authorization through the parent project (recorded in the
api-guards self-guarding list). UI: a memory panel on the project page.

**Incidental fix.** `createProject` bound one placeholder (`$4`) to both a text
column (`created_by`) and a uuid column (`owner_user_id`), which Postgres
refuses to type-deduce ("inconsistent types deduced for parameter $4"); the path
had no test. Split into two placeholders, behaviour preserved (owner defaults to
the creator).

**Tests.** `ai-projects.test.ts` extended (23/23: the ProjectContext form, the
memory block, the name line, backward compat, bounds constants); new
`integration/ai-project-memory.integration.test.ts` (8/8: create/read,
char-limit + empty + full bounds, delete, and the prompt-context round-trip that
proves a project finally shapes a turn, plus cross-tenant null);
`tenant-isolation` covers 0158; `api-guards` extended. Full suite **4820 unit
tests / 326 files**; `tsc` clean.

**Deferred to Phase F Part 2+:** AI-authored memory through a confirmed action,
project files (link table to the Media Library — waits on Phase G provenance
columns), project tasks, project members, and entity `project_id` FKs on
agents/coworkers/automations. Part 1 deliberately keeps memory human-curated so
the write path and the prompt-context path could land, reviewed, without also
introducing a new catalogue action in the same step.

## 6f (cont.) — Phase F Part 2 DELIVERED (AI-authored project memory)

Part 1 added the `ai_project_memory.source` column ('user' | 'ai') but nothing
wrote 'ai' — memory was human-curated only. Part 2 closes that loop: the
assistant can now propose a standing fact for the CURRENT project, and it
establishes the **ambient project-id injection** pattern that project files and
tasks will reuse.

**A new, project-scoped action.** `project.memory.add` joins the catalogue
(`endpoint: /api/ai/projects/{projectId}/memory`, `alwaysConfirm`, no executor /
category / coworkerOnly — it never runs unattended and is never an MCP write).
It is the first action tagged `projectScoped`: an action addressed by an ambient
id the model must never see. The mechanics that keep it safe:

- **Kept out of the default enum.** `BASE_ACTION_TYPES` (every non-project-scoped
  action) is what `propose_action` offers on a plain dashboard/wizard turn;
  `PROJECT_ACTION_TYPES` (base + project-scoped) is offered only when
  `toolDefinitions`/`buildSystemPrompt` are told the turn is `projectScoped`.
  This mirrors how `coworkerOnly` already keeps waste out of the model's enum.
- **Offered only inside a project, never to an agent.** The chat route sets
  `projectScoped` only when it resolved an `activeProjectId` AND there is no
  scoped custom agent (an agent's action list is its own and a project does not
  widen it).
- **The model never names the id.** The payload hint asks for `content` only;
  the route injects the resolved `activeProjectId` (and `source: "ai"`) into the
  proposal payload after the turn, so the confirm card, the audit and the apply
  call all target this project and no other.
- **Server-side backstop.** `runAgentTurn` refuses a parsed proposal whose
  action is `projectScoped` when the turn was not project-scoped — a hand-crafted
  response naming `project.memory.add` on a project-less turn is dropped, not
  applied, the same shape as the existing agent-allowlist backstop.
- **Apply path unchanged.** `resolveActionEndpoint` fills `{projectId}` from the
  injected payload; a proposal missing the id resolves to null and cannot fire.

**Tests.** `ai.test.ts` +9 (catalogue shape, BASE vs PROJECT enums, offered
only when project-scoped, never to a read-only/scoped agent, prompt-catalogue
naming, endpoint resolution) and the `alwaysConfirm` set now pins three entries;
`ai-service.test.ts` +2 (a project turn accepts `project.memory.add` with no id
in the payload; a non-project turn refuses a crafted one). Full suite **4830
unit tests / 326 files**; `tsc` clean; project-memory + tenant-isolation
integration green.

**Still deferred to Phase F Part 3+:** project files (link table to the Media
Library — waits on Phase G provenance columns), project tasks, project members,
and entity `project_id` FKs on agents/coworkers/automations.

## 6f (cont.) — Phase F Part 3 DELIVERED (project tasks — a lifecycle, not just facts)

Notes and memory are STATELESS (a fact is simply true). Part 3 adds the one
thing a workspace lacks: a unit of work with a LIFECYCLE. A **task** is
"something to do for this project", open until done — two states, no assignee /
due date / priority yet (the same restraint 0111 showed deferring those columns).

**Schema.** Migration `0159_ai_project_tasks.sql` — `ai_project_tasks`
(title, `status` open|done, `source` user|ai, `completed_at` nullable),
CASCADE off ai_projects, RLS `tenant_isolation` via the parent project row
(mirrors 0158/0111), plus a partial index on open tasks (the hot read).

**Service (`ai-projects.ts`).** `addTask` (title trim + `PROJECT_TASK_CHAR_LIMIT`
bound + `PROJECT_TASK_MAX_OPEN` cap counting only OPEN tasks, so completing one
frees a slot and the prompt context can't grow without bound), `listTasks`
(open-first), `setTaskStatus` (stamps/clears `completed_at` via an ownership
join, returns null cross-tenant), `deleteTask`. `ProjectContext.openTasks` and
`buildProjectPromptContext` render only OPEN tasks under
`کارهای باز پروژه (هنوز انجام‌نشده):`; `getProjectPromptContext` loads them in
the same one-pass Promise.all — so completing a task drops it from every future
turn.

**Action + routes.** `project.task.add` — project-scoped, `alwaysConfirm`,
ambient project id injected server-side (model supplies only `title`); rides the
generic chat-route projectScoped injection unchanged. REST:
`/api/ai/projects/[id]/tasks` (GET/POST) and `.../[taskId]` (PATCH toggle,
DELETE). Project page gets a tasks list (toggle/add/delete) above memory.

**Tests.** `ai.test.ts` +3 and the `alwaysConfirm` set now pins **four** entries
(`ar.receipt.record`, `project.memory.add`, `project.task.add`,
`website.post.publish`); `ai-projects.test.ts` +2 (open-task rendering, bounds);
`api-guards.test.ts` covers the two new routes; new
`ai-project-tasks.integration.test.ts` (10 tests) proves the round-trip
open-task → prompt-context → complete → drops-out, plus bounds and cross-tenant
null. Full suite **4837 unit tests / 326 files**; `tsc` clean; task +
tenant-isolation integration green. Commit `503dca9`.

**Still deferred to Phase F Part 4+:** project files (Media Library link — waits
on Phase G), project members, and entity `project_id` FKs on
agents/coworkers/automations.

## 6f (cont.) — Phase F Part 4 DELIVERED (a project's conversation list, scoped in SQL)

`listConversationsByProject` (ai-conversations.ts) was written at Phase 35 Wave 3
and never called — the **last** piece of the projects-are-workspaces dead code
§1.5 named. The project page instead pulled the caller's most recent 50
conversations across ALL projects and filtered client-side by `projectId`, so a
project with more threads than that page limit silently lost its older ones.

- `/api/ai/conversations` now accepts `?project=<id>`, routing to
  `listConversationsByProject` (ownership-scoped in SQL, same ownership rule as
  the unfiltered list) instead of fetch-then-filter.
- The project page requests `?project=<id>&limit=100` and drops the client
  filter.
- `ai-conversations.integration.test.ts` +2 (only the caller's own threads for
  that project, newest-active first — not other projects, not project-less
  threads, not another member's; and the limit is honoured). 6/6 in that file.

Only `getConversationProjectId` and `buildProjectPromptContext` remained live
from that Wave; both are wired (Part 1). **No Phase-35 project dead code
remains.** Commit `ef9be91`.

**Still deferred to Phase F Part 5+:** project files (Media Library link — waits
on Phase G provenance columns), project members, and entity `project_id` FKs on
agents/coworkers/automations.

## 6f (cont.) — Phase F Part 5 DELIVERED (a project pins a default agent)

Parts 1–4 let a project INFORM a turn (instruction, notes, memory, tasks, its
own thread list). Part 5 lets it SCOPE one — closing the "attached agents" gap
§1.5 named. A project can pin a Phase-D custom agent (0154) as its default, and
every conversation opened in the project runs as that agent (its tone, and only
the actions it may propose) without the caller re-selecting it.

**Safety inherited, not re-invented.** Pinning can only NARROW a turn — an
agent's tool/action allowlists are a validated subset of the catalogue
(ai-custom-agents.ts). A request-level `agentId` still wins over the project
default; a project-scoped turn that runs as an agent does NOT also gain the
project-scoped write actions (an agent's action list is its own — the existing
"`projectScoped` only when there is no agent" rule in the chat route). So it
never widens anyone's authority.

**Schema.** `migrations/0160_ai_project_default_agent.sql` — one nullable column
`ai_projects.default_agent_id` → `ai_custom_agents(id)` **ON DELETE SET NULL**:
deleting or disabling the agent falls back to the full assistant, never orphans
the project. No new table, no default → every existing project behaves exactly
as before.

**Service (`ai-projects.ts`).** `defaultAgentId` on `AiProject` and
`ProjectContext`; `updateProject` validates the pin is a real, ENABLED agent of
this business (else `project_default_agent_not_found`; clearing with null is
always allowed) and threads it through every project SELECT.
`getProjectPromptContext` carries the pin so the chat route resolves the agent
in the same pass it loads the rest.

**Chat route.** In the project-context block, when the project pins an agent and
the request named none, the turn is run as the pinned agent
(`getCustomAgent` + `agentTurnScope`, both already tested) and
`promptContext.agent` is set; `projectScoped` stays false in that case, as
before.

**Routes + UI.** Project PATCH accepts `defaultAgentId`; project GET returns the
pinnable (enabled) agents; the project page's operations card gains an agent
picker ("دستیار کامل" = none) and a read-mode line.

**Tests.** `ai-projects.test.ts` fixtures extended for the new field; new
`ai-project-default-agent.integration.test.ts` (7: pin/read/clear,
omit-preserves-pin, disabled + cross-tenant refused, ON DELETE SET NULL,
ProjectContext carries the pin). Full suite **4837 unit / 326 files**; `tsc`
clean; default-agent + tenant-isolation + project-memory integration green.
Commit `f1cc000`.

**Still deferred to Phase F Part 6+:** project files (Media Library link — waits
on Phase G provenance columns), project members, and `project_id` FKs on
coworkers/automations (agents are now reachable from a project via the pin).

## 6f (cont.) — Phase F CAPSTONE DELIVERED + Phase F CLOSED (project files)

The last deferred Phase F item, unblocked once Phase G pt.1 gave `media_assets`
a `project_id` and pt.2 tagged chat images with it: a project shows its own
files.

- `GET /api/ai/projects/[id]/files` — ownership through the parent project (the
  same shape as notes/memory/tasks), then `listMediaAssets` scoped by business +
  `project_id`. Read-only: files are authored through the chat/media write paths
  and tagged with provenance there.
- Project page: a read-only files panel (image thumbnails / document icons,
  «ساختهٔ دستیار» / «از گفت‌وگو» provenance badges, links to
  `/api/media/[id]/file`). api-guards covers the route. Commit `a24a775`.

**Phase F (Projects as workspaces) is COMPLETE.** A project now: shapes every
turn with its instruction + notes + memory + open tasks (pt.1–3, live prompt
context); owns its conversation list scoped in SQL (pt.4); can pin a default
agent that scopes those turns (pt.5); and holds its own files (capstone). Still
genuinely out of scope for later phases (not blocking): project members, and
`project_id` FKs on coworkers/automations.

## 6g. Phase G — Parts 1–2 DELIVERED (media persistence: the Part 21 gap)

The audit named it in §1.6: AI chat attachments were deliberately non-persistent
(`ai-attachment.ts`: "nothing here touches a table or object storage"), and
`media_assets` had no provenance columns, so a receipt pasted into chat or an
image the assistant made vanished when the turn ended.

**Part 1 — provenance vocabulary (`migrations/0161`).** `media_assets` gains
`source` ('upload'|'ai_attachment'|'ai_generated', CHECK-pinned),
`created_by_ai`, `conversation_id` → ai_conversations and `project_id` →
ai_projects, both **ON DELETE SET NULL** (a file outlives the thread/project that
made it). Partial indexes on the two workspace reads. Every column is
backfill-safe (existing assets stay "human upload, no workspace"). No RLS change
— media_assets is already tenant-isolated (0149). `media-service`:
`MediaAssetRecord` + `storeMediaAsset` carry provenance (`createdByAi` derived
from `source` — an ai_attachment is the user's own file, only ai_generated is
AI-authored); `listMediaAssets` gains `conversationId`/`projectId` filters.
Commit `bfbcf5c`.

**Part 2 — the write path (`ai-media-persist.ts`).** Pure `decodeImageDataUrl`
(validates + decodes a base64 image data URL, fail-closed on MIME/byte-signature
mismatch — a script mislabeled as PNG is refused) + `chatAttachmentFileName`;
and best-effort `persistChatImageAttachments` (reads media config, stores each
valid image with `source='ai_attachment'` + conversation/project, never throws).
PDFs are not stored — their value is the extracted text, not a document-library
entry per upload. The chat route fires it non-blocking after the turn's
conversation + project resolve (dashboard/wizard only). Commit `7b7d0aa`.

**Tests.** `ai-media-persist.test.ts` (10, pure decode + filename);
media-library integration +8 (provenance defaults, ai_attachment/ai_generated,
conversation/project filters, ON DELETE SET NULL keeps the asset, and the
persist round-trip incl. skipping a same-turn PDF, skipping when storage is off,
refusing a mislabeled image). Full suite **4848 unit / 327 files**; `tsc` clean.

**Still to do in Phase G:** persist AI-*generated* images (needs an image-
generation call site to exist in the chat flow first — auto-tagging/enhance
already persist through the library's own upload path); a media provenance badge
on the main library page. **Deferred, blocked:** Phase H (cache/RAG → LiteLLM)
still requires empirical verification against the deployed
`ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:main-stable` image before any local removal — no prod
access in this environment, so it stays untouched per the standing rule.
