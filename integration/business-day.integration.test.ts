/**
 * The business day (روز کاری) against a real database — the whole point of the
 * feature is a date rule that PostgreSQL evaluates, so nothing here can be
 * usefully unit tested (the arithmetic-free half is business-day.test.ts).
 *
 * What this pins down, using the case that motivated it — a café trading
 * 18:00 → 03:00, business day starting at 18:00:
 *   1. an order rung after local midnight keeps the *previous* date's business
 *      day, so one night's service is one report row instead of two;
 *   2. the reporting views agree with that, since they all derive their date
 *      from the same function;
 *   3. the orders screen's window covers the whole service across midnight,
 *      and does not reset at 00:00 the way the calendar day did;
 *   4. closing the day by hand at 03:00 empties that window immediately, and
 *      the next evening's service starts from zero;
 *   5. a closure expires on its own once the next business day begins, so
 *      nothing has to be cleaned up;
 *   6. reopening undoes a close taken by mistake;
 *   7. closures never move a sale between report rows — the 04:00 order after a
 *      03:00 close is still filed under the business day it was sold in;
 *   8. a branch that has configured no business day behaves exactly as it did
 *      before this feature existed, calendar day and open-shift widening
 *      included;
 *   9. the business day is per branch: configuring one leaves the other alone;
 *  10. `businessToday` — the business-wide date the cross-server rollup and the
 *      AI assistant's default range anchor on — follows the same rule, instead
 *      of the calendar day it used to name;
 *  11. the cash-up ends the night: once the branch's last shift is closed the
 *      live window starts there, so the board is zero for the rest of the day
 *      instead of showing last night's takings until 18:00 comes round — the
 *      bug this feature shipped with — while a cash-up with a colleague still
 *      clocked in is treated as a handover and changes nothing.
