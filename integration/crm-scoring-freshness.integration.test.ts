/**
 * RFM freshness: the job, the debounce, and the rule that matters most.
 *
 * ## The rule that matters most
 *
 * **Scoring must never happen on the checkout path.** RFM is a
 * whole-population quintile calculation — a customer is in the top recency
 * quintile only relative to everyone else — so "rescore because this person
 * just bought something" means scanning every customer and every order. On the
 * payment path that means the till waits for a report on a busy Friday, and,
 * far worse, a failure inside a *reporting* calculation would fail the *sale*.
 *
 * So checkout does one tiny thing: it marks the business dirty. A background
 * tick does the scanning. The first test below is the one that would catch a
 * well-meaning future change to that arrangement.
 *
 * The rest cover the properties that make the job trustworthy rather than
 * merely present: it debounces so a rush is one scan and not two hundred; it
 * rescores on the calendar even with no activity, because recency decays
 * whether or not anyone buys anything; it cannot be claimed twice; it records
 * failures instead of swallowing them; and a run does not discard a change
 * that arrived while it was running.
