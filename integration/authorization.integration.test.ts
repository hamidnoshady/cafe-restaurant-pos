/**
 * The authorization model against a real database.
 *
 * The unit suites pin the policy functions; this file pins the things that
 * only a database can answer, and that the refactor changed:
 *
 *   1. RLS still isolates tenants — the permission layer sits on top of that
 *      boundary, it does not replace it;
 *   2. `users.location_scope` (migration 0170) actually constrains branch
 *      reach, including the case that used to roam: no rows, NULL home;
 *   3. the migration's backfill preserved every existing member's access
 *      rather than narrowing anyone at deploy;
 *   4. an effective permission set resolves from the row as stored, so an
 *      override takes effect on the next request with no re-authentication;
 *   5. the guards read the *database* role, so a demotion cannot be outrun by
 *      a token minted before it.
