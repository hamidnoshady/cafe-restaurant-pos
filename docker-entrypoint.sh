# Container entrypoint for the POS app.
#
# 1. Wait until Postgres accepts connections (the db service may still be
#    starting when this container boots).
# 2. Apply forward-only migrations (safe to run every boot — already-applied
#    files are skipped; nothing to do on an up-to-date schema).
# 3. Derive the connection string the SERVER PROCESS should run with, which is
#    deliberately not always the same as $DATABASE_URL above. Every shipped
#    compose file hands this container one Postgres superuser for both
#    migrating and running — but Phase 12's tenant isolation is Postgres row-
#    level security, which a superuser ignores outright, and the app refuses
#    to start in production against a connection like that (src/lib/db.ts,
#    assertRlsEffective). Rather than require every deployment's compose file
#    to be hand-edited, this provisions the restricted `pos_app` role from the
#    privileged connection and launches the server with that instead — see
#    scripts/derive-runtime-database-url.ts for exactly what it checks before
#    doing so (an explicit RUNTIME_DATABASE_URL, or an already-restricted
#    DATABASE_URL, both skip provisioning).
# 4. Hand off to CMD (the production server) with that connection string, while
#    keeping the privileged one as BACKUP_DATABASE_URL: `pg_dump` (the Phase 10
#    backup) runs with row_security off, which Postgres refuses for a role that
#    can't bypass RLS, so a whole-database dump has to use the owner connection
#    — see dumpDatabaseUrl() in src/lib/backup.ts.
