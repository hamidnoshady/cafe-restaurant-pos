/**
 * Local storage configuration for the desktop app — the audit fix for
 * Section 3 ("Local storage configuration wizard: let user choose
 * drive/folder for DB, attachments, images, reports, local backups, printer
 * config; provide Browse button, disk-space check, permission check, test
 * folder access").
 *
 * Before this module, the desktop app had exactly one folder an owner could
 * point anywhere: the backup destination (`src/app/setup/backup/page.tsx`,
 * saved through `/api/backup/config`). Everything else — the embedded
 * Postgres data directory, `config.json`, logs — was hard-coded to Electron's
 * `userData` path (`electron/backend-manager.js`'s `loadOrCreateConfig`) with
 * no visibility, no space check, and no way to move it to a bigger disk
 * before first run, which is exactly when it matters (an embedded Postgres
 * data directory, once initialised, is not something this app relocates
 * later without a full backup/restore).
 *
 * This module is the FIRST-RUN, pre-Postgres half of that fix: a plain
 * Node/Electron-side check of a folder BEFORE the app commits to it —
 * writable?, how much free space does its volume report?, does a real file
 * survive a write+read+delete round trip? — surfaced to the renderer via IPC
 * (`desktop:storage-*`, see main.js) and consumed by the local-storage setup
 * step (`src/app/setup/storage/page.tsx`). Every side-effecting piece takes
 * injectable collaborators (`fsp`, `platform`) so the decision logic here is
 * unit-testable without touching a real disk — see
 * src/lib/local-storage.test.ts.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does NOT do: move an already-initialised
 * Postgres data directory. Once `pgdata` exists, `backend-manager.js` always
 * reads `app.getPath("userData")`; relocating it is a distinct, higher-risk
 * feature (stop Postgres, move ~100+ files, verify, restart) that belongs
 * with the Section 10 restore/relocate wizard, not first-run folder choice.
