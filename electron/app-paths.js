/**
 * Application/Data/Backup/Logs/Configuration folder split — the audit fix
 * for Section 8 ("installer should create separate Application/Data/Backup/
 * Logs/Configuration folders").
 *
 * The "Application" folder is already separate: electron-builder's NSIS
 * installer puts the program binaries under Program Files (or wherever the
 * owner picks during setup, via `allowToChangeInstallationDirectory`), which
 * has never been mixed with this app's runtime data. What WAS flat, before
 * this module, was everything under Electron's own `userData` directory:
 * `config.json`, the embedded Postgres data directory (`pgdata`), the local
 * HTTPS gateway's CA/certificates, log files, and emergency pre-restore
 * dumps all lived directly in one undifferentiated folder
 * (`backend-manager.js`'s `loadOrCreateConfig`/`emergencyBackupDir`,
 * `logger.js`'s `logDir`, `certificate-manager.js`'s `directory`).
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for where each of those now
 * lives — Configuration/, Data/ (+ Data/pgdata, Data/gateway-certificates),
 * Backup/ (+ Backup/emergency-backups), Logs/ — and the one-time migration
 * that moves an EXISTING install's flat layout into it. `main.js` calls
 * `migrateLegacyLayout()` exactly once, right after `runStorageBootstrap()`
 * resolves the final `userData` root (default or owner-chosen) and before
 * `logger.js`/`backend-manager.js`/`certificate-manager.js` compute any path
 * from it, so nothing ever reads from the old flat locations after this
 * runs. A completed migration is recorded in `LEGACY_MIGRATION_MARKER` so it
 * runs at most once per install; this is the same "marker file next to the
 * data it describes" shape `local-storage.js` already uses for the storage
 * root choice.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT the same thing as `local-storage.js`'s Section 3
 * wizard: that module lets the owner point *business* data (attachments,
 * images, reports, backups they manage) at any drive/folder they like — a
 * decision that is scoped to where the app looks for that content, not to
 * how Electron's own per-machine `userData` directory is organised
 * internally. This module only reorganises the latter.
 *
 * Every side-effecting function accepts an injectable `fs` (the sync fs
 * API), so the decision logic — what counts as "already migrated", which
 * entries need to move, how a cross-device move degrades gracefully — is
 * unit-testable without a real multi-volume machine. See
 * src/lib/app-paths.test.ts.
