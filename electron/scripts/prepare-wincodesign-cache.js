/**
 * Pre-populate electron-builder's `winCodeSign` cache, working around a
 * Windows-only extraction failure that otherwise stops the build before it
 * ever produces the installer `.exe`.
 *
 * Why this is needed even though we don't code-sign anything:
 *
 * electron-builder downloads the `winCodeSign` bundle unconditionally on
 * Windows — not for signing (that's correctly skipped with no certificate),
 * but because the same archive carries `rcedit`, which stamps the app icon,
 * product name and version onto `Cafe POS.exe`. Without it the build fails,
 * and even a build that skips it (`win.signAndEditExecutable: false`) ships an
 * exe still branded "Electron" with the stock Electron icon.
 *
 * The failure: the archive contains macOS symlinks
 * (darwin/10.12/lib/libcrypto.dylib, libssl.dylib). Creating a symlink on
 * Windows needs SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege — which a normal, non-elevated
 * account without Developer Mode doesn't hold — so 7-Zip exits non-zero:
 *
 *     ERROR: Cannot create symbolic link : A required privilege is not held
 *     by the client. : ...\darwin\10.12\lib\libcrypto.dylib
 *
 * electron-builder treats that non-zero exit as fatal, retries four times, and
 * gives up. Nothing in the `darwin/` or `linux/` trees is used when building a
 * Windows installer on Windows, so this script extracts the archive itself with
 * those two directories excluded and leaves the result exactly where
 * electron-builder looks for it. electron-builder then finds a populated cache
 * and skips the download that would have failed.
 *
 * Idempotent and best-effort: if the cache is already populated it does
 * nothing, and any unexpected failure here is a warning rather than an error —
 * electron-builder is still free to try the download itself (which is what
 * happens on machines where extraction works fine, e.g. CI runners and
 * Developer-Mode machines).
