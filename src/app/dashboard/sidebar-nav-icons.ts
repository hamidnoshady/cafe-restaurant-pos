/**
 * One glyph per navigation href.
 *
 * Split out of `dashboard-sidebar.tsx` for the same reason
 * `sidebar-nav-styles.ts` was: an app's own nav component has to draw the
 * business pages it adopts (the Accounting workspace lists فاکتورها، انبار،
 * محصولات beside its ledger sections), and importing the shell that imports
 * the app would close a cycle. Two icon maps over one set of pages is how the
 * same page ends up with two faces.
 *
 * Keyed by href, because that is the stable identity of a page — the label is
 * the trade's word for it and changes per industry.
