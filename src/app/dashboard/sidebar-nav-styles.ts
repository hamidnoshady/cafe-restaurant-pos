 * One button skin for every entry in the dashboard's navigation column — the
 * workspace rail, the classic flat nav, and an app's own main sidebar.
 *
 * It lives apart from `dashboard-sidebar.tsx` because an app's nav component
 * (e.g. `growth/growth-app-nav.tsx`) has to wear it too, and importing the shell
 * that imports the app would close a cycle. Amber is selection
 * (docs/design-system.md §Colour roles), so all three menus agree on what
 * "you are here" looks like.
 *
 * Every amber shade is paired with a dark one. The selected entry's fill and
 * text used to have no dark counterpart, which painted a light chip on the
 * dark rail — the one place in the sidebar where "you are here" was harder to
 * read than a plain hover.
