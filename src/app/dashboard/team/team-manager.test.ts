/**
 * The wiring invariants of the persons directory, the team screen, and the
 * user section — the seams no other harness reaches.
 *
 * The repo's vitest runs in Node with no jsdom and no `@testing-library`
 * (see accounting-nav-rtl.test.ts), and the cookie-session API routes cannot
 * be invoked outside a Next request store (see the withTenantScope doc
 * comment in auth.ts) — so the pure rules these screens obey already live in
 * framework-free modules and are unit-tested there (`resolveMemberLocationAssignment`
 * in team.test.ts, `partiesSectionAbilities` in parties-scopes.test.ts,
 * `directoryFilterCategories` in party-directory.test.ts), and the database
 * behaviour is pinned in integration/team and integration/parties.
 *
 * What only grepping the sources can hold is the *wiring*: that the screen
 * sends what the route accepts, that a rename reaches the personnel file but a
 * suspend does not, that the pre-rename CRM addresses are redirects rather
 * than a second copy of the screen, that the wizard offers every role its
 * route will create, and that the label maps and permission-threading this
 * cleanup deduplicated do not quietly grow back.
