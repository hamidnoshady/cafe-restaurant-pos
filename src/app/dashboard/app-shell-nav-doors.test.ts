/**
 * Every app that owns a shell must be entered through its own app-home route.
 *
 * The dashboard's flat nav (built in `workspace-shell.tsx`) carries one door per app.
 * For an app with a shell (`src/lib/app-shells.ts` — Growth, the Website
 * manager, the CRM), that door's href must live *inside* the shell's own
 * prefix, e.g. `/crm/overview` and not the legacy `/dashboard/customers`.
 *
 * Two independent behaviours ride on that single fact, which is why a door
 * pointing at a legacy route broke both at once for the CRM:
 *
 *   1. The workspace rail launches each app by finding its app-home href among
 *      the nav's hrefs (`WORKSPACE_APP_LAUNCHERS` in `dashboard-sidebar.tsx`).
 *      A door at `/dashboard/customers` is never `/crm/overview`, so the CRM
 *      launcher matched nothing and «ارتباط با مشتری» vanished from the rail's
 *      «برنامه‌ها» list while Growth and the Website app stayed.
 *   2. In the workspace shell the flat nav drops every entry whose href is
 *      inside an app shell (`isInsideAnyAppShell`), because that app is reached
 *      from the rail instead. A door outside the shell prefix is *not* dropped,
 *      so it kept surfacing while the member was inside another app such as
 *      حسابداری — the CRM leaking into Accounting.
 *
 * This test greps the shell's source (the same source-of-truth approach
 * `design-lint.test.ts` uses) so the invariant holds without importing the
 * server component, which pulls in the database pool.
