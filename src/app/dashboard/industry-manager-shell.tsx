/**
 * Phase 25 Wave 4 — the chrome the three industry manager pages share.
 *
 * `jewelry-manager.tsx`, `watch-manager.tsx` and `accessories-manager.tsx` were
 * written one per wave and ended up as three copies of the same thing: an error
 * box, a tab strip with identical markup and classes, a labelled region for the
 * active tab, and the same `Runner` callback shape passed down to every
 * section. Only the tab list and the sections differ. Keeping three copies
 * meant a fix to the tab strip's focus ring or its ARIA wiring had to be made
 * three times — and, as of this wave, a fourth if another industry is added.
 *
 * The tab strip itself is now `<SectionNav>` (section-nav.tsx), shared with
 * every other tabbed screen in the dashboard — a pill strip from `md` up, and
 * on a phone a list that drills into one section at a time. What is left here
 * is the industry managers' own contract: the `Runner` shape and the error box
 * above the strip.
