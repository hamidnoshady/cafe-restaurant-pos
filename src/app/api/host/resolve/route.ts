/**
 * What business is this hostname? — the Node-runtime half of host resolution.
 *
 * Middleware answers the *isolation* question on Edge by comparing the host's
 * label to the session's own claim, which needs no database. This route
 * answers the *directory* question, which does: whether a label belongs to a
 * business at all, and whether it is an old host that has since been renamed.
 *
 * Deliberately session-less, and deliberately narrow. It reveals only what the
 * DNS record and the TLS certificate already reveal — that a subdomain is or
 * is not in use, and where a renamed one now points — and nothing about the
 * business behind it beyond its display name, which its own login page shows
 * anyway. Callers are the apex router (does this name exist?) and an alias
 * host redirecting itself to the current name.
 *
 * `?debug=1` adds what the app *saw* — the two host headers, which of them the
 * tenancy decision used, and how it parsed. Behind a managed platform that
 * rewrites `Host`, this is the only way to find out that it does: every symptom
 * of it (endless redirects to the apex, a login that never sticks) looks like
 * something else. It echoes the caller's own request headers back to them,
 * plus the root domain, which is in the URL they typed — so the one new fact
 * it can reveal is the platform's internal hostname for the container.
