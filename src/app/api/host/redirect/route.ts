/**
 * "This host isn't the one that serves you — where should you be?"
 *
 * The Node-runtime half of the two cases middleware can see but cannot
 * resolve, because the Edge runtime has no database:
 *
 *  - **an alias host.** After a subdomain rename the old host must keep
 *    working. `page.tsx` handles that for `/`, but a real bookmark is a deep
 *    path, and every deep path hits the isolation check first — which fails
 *    closed and bounces to a login on a host that serves nobody. Middleware
 *    now sends those here instead.
 *  - **a legacy `/{slug}/dashboard` URL.** Slug and subdomain agree for every
 *    business 0066 backfilled but diverge as soon as an admin sets a real
 *    subdomain, so the slug cannot be reinterpreted as a host label.
 *
 * Session-less by necessity — the visitor's session is either absent or valid
 * for a different origin, which is why they are here. This reveals nothing
 * beyond what DNS and the certificate already do: whether a name is in use,
 * and where a renamed one now points. It reads no tenant data and issues only
 * redirects.
