 * Checkout: records the payment and completes the order. This is the

 * hook into — this is the only place an order reaches status 'completed'.
 * It is therefore also where a dine-in table is handed back to the floor:
 * settling the session's last active order frees its tables automatically
 * (releaseTableAfterOrderSettled), so there is no manual "close the table"
 * step and no second place that decides whether a table is occupied. Since migration
 * 0091 one order may be settled across several payment ways at once — ۲۰۰٬۰۰۰
 * نقدی plus ۳۰۰٬۰۰۰ کارت‌خوان is one checkout, one `payments` row per slice,
 * and one journal entry with a debit line per slice. What has not changed is
 * that a checkout settles the bill *in full*: the slices must add up to the
 * order total, while a separately entered tip is added to the ledger and
 * receipt, so there is still no partial payment and no balance left open.
 * Several parties on one table stay several orders, each settled here on its
 * own; the table is only released once the last of them is finalized.
 *
 * This is also the inventory deduction trigger (Phase 6): completing an
 * order is the one place order_items become immutable (they can only be
 * added/voided/requantified while status = 'open'), so it's the only
 * correct, exactly-once point to consume recipe ingredients. Payment
 * recording, order completion, and deduction all happen in one transaction.
 *
 * Same transaction also posts two Phase 7 journal entries: the payment
 * itself (Debit Cash/Bank-Clearing/Accounts-Receivable — or, for a SnapFood
 * order (issue #160 §4), Receivable-from-Online-Platforms net of SnapFood's
 * commission, with the commission itself debited to its own expense account
 * — for the bill *plus* any tip / Credit the order's channel-specific Sales
 * Revenue account, split by orders.type since Phase 22 Wave 4 — + Tax
 * Payable + Tips Payable if a tip was collected, issue #160 §4 — a
 * pass-through liability, never revenue) and the COGS entry from the
 * deduction's total cost (Debit COGS / Credit Inventory Asset).
