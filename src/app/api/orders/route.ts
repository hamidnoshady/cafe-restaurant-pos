/**
 * Open orders for the cashier's "current orders" list.
 *
 * `?scope=shift` additionally returns the orders already settled in the
 * branch's current window (`closedOrders`, newest close first) plus the window
 * itself, for the orders screen — a closed order is otherwise invisible the
 * moment it is paid. Only that screen asks for it, so the POS and waiter
 * panels, which poll this route for their queue, keep paying for one query.
 *
 * Which orders those are is decided by when each was *opened*, not when it was
 * paid (see `listSettledOrdersInWindow`): a bill this shift opened stays in this
 * list however late it is settled, and a bill carried over from an earlier shift
 * or an already-closed day is left with the shift that opened it rather than
 * counted here a second time. The still-open queue above is unbounded either
 * way, so a carried-over table is always settleable — it simply files itself
 * back under its own shift once it is.
 *
 * The default window is today's business day at the branch, widened to a
 * still-running shift that began earlier (see branchClosedOrdersWindow);
 * `shiftStartedAt` is reported alongside so the screen can name which of the
 * two it is showing. A branch that has configured a business day (روز کاری)
 * gets that day's window instead, reported as `businessDay` so the screen can
 * say which trading day — and whether management has already closed it —
 * rather than calling it "today".
 *
 * An owner or manager may instead ask for one shift by id (`&shiftId=`), and
 * gets the branch's recent shifts back as that picker's options — reviewing a
 * shift someone else worked is a supervisory privilege, the same audience
 * /api/reports/shift-orders serves, so a cashier or waiter is answered with the
 * default window and no shift list. The id is resolved *within* the branch's
 * own list rather than by its own query, so an unknown or foreign id falls back
 * to the default window instead of reaching another branch's shift.
