/**
 * The API authorization contract — asserted against the route sources.
 *
 * ## Why source inspection rather than live requests
 *
 * The repository has no integration harness that can boot a tenant, a session
 * and Postgres for each of ~900 route files, and the property these tests guard
 * is structural rather than behavioural: *every route has a guard, and the
 * guard is the canonical one*. A route that forgets its guard entirely, or that
 * reintroduces a bespoke role comparison, is a security regression that this
 * catches at the exact moment it is written — which is the point. The
 * behaviour of the guard itself is tested directly in `src/lib/authorize.test.ts`.
 *
 * Three properties are enforced:
 *
 *   1. No route handler is unguarded.
 *   2. No route re-implements authorization inline instead of calling a guard.
 *   3. The families migrated off role-only gating stay migrated.
