/**
 * Growth & Marketing data as seen from accounting (Phase 36b, revised).
 *
 * The growth app posts to the ledger through its own posting rules — issuing a
 * gift card credits ۲۴۲۰, store credit ۲۴۱۰, commission expenses ۵۲۱۰ and
 * accrues ۲۳۰۰ — all in the backend, with no connection UI in the growth app.
 * This endpoint lets accounting *see* that same data: the bridge balances and
 * the rolling KPIs, reconstructed from `journal_lines` exactly the way the trial
 * balance reconstructs them, so a number here can never disagree with the
 * books. Owner, manager and accountant may read it.
 *
 * It answers with a subset rather than the whole overview: accounting has no
 * business reading the repurchase list or the growth activity feed.
