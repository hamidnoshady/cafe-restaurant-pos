/**
 * The estimates of one project (issue #799 §7).
 *
 * GET  — every estimate with its revisions, newest first, plus the project's
 *        BOQ variance (the approved revision against the ledger's actual cost).
 *        An empty list is the normal first answer: most projects never keep a
 *        BOQ at all.
 * POST — create an estimate, which arrives with its first draft revision so the
 *        editor has somewhere to put a line.
 *
 * Both go through the workspace module's per-project authorization on top of
 * the platform permission, exactly like the profile and participants routes
 * next door: `workspace.view` narrows to «میز کار من», `requireProjectCapability`
 * narrows to this project, and `workspace.manage` is the escape hatch for the
 * business's own owner/manager.
