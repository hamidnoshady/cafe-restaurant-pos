/**
 * One submittal (issue #799 §11): its identity, its attachments and its whole
 * revision history with each revision's determination.
 *
 * The project is resolved from the submittal *before* the authorization check,
 * so a manager of another project is refused here as everywhere else.
 *
 * PATCH edits the register entry. Once a revision is out with a reviewer the
 * number, the type and the specification section are frozen (the service refuses
 * and migration 0198's `aec_submittal_guard()` refuses again): changing what a
 * submission answers after it was reviewed would rewrite what was approved.
 * DELETE is refused while any revision has been submitted — the log keeps what
 * was sent, and the escape hatch is only for a register entry created by mistake.
