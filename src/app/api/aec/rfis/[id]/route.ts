/**
 * One RFI (issue #799 §10): its question, who owes the answer, its impacts, its
 * attachments and whether it is late.
 *
 * The project is resolved from the RFI *before* the authorization check, so a
 * manager of another project in the same business is refused here exactly as
 * they are on the project's own routes.
 *
 * PATCH edits what is still editable — §33 is the rule: the number and the
 * question freeze when the RFI leaves draft, and the response freezes once it
 * exists. The service refuses, and migration 0198's trigger refuses again.
 * DELETE is a draft-only escape hatch for an RFI raised by mistake.
 *
 * `+` on `PATCH status` is deliberately *not* how an RFI is answered: the four
 * acts of §10's chain have their own route (`…/status`), because each has its
 * own consequences and one of them writes the response.
