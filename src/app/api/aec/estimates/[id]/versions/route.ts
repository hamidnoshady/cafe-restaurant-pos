/**
 * A new revision of an estimate (issue #799 §7's "versioning").
 *
 * POST — always a draft. With `cloneFromVersionId` it copies that revision's
 *        chapters and lines, which is how a real revision works: you change
 *        four rates, not the whole BOQ. Copying an approved revision is
 *        explicitly allowed and is the normal case — that revision is frozen,
 *        and its successor is a draft that happens to start from its numbers.
