/**
 * The Accounting home's quick report — the branch's running sales for the
 * shift now in progress.
 *
 * Unlike the rest of `/api/ledger/*` this reads orders/payments rather than
 * `journal_lines`, deliberately: the box reports the till, not the books, and
 * it goes back to zero at every shift close (`branchShiftSales` anchors the
 * window on the branch's most recent cash-up). It lives under the ledger
 * prefix because the ledger's own door gates it — owner/manager/accountant,
 * the Accounting app's line — and the `ledger` feature flag applies.
