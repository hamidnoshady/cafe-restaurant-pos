/**
 * The one guard + error mapping every `/api/data/*` route uses.
 *
 * Shaped after `src/app/api/workspace/guard.ts` for the same reason it exists:
 * a dozen route files would otherwise repeat the same permission check, owner
 * construction and error mapping, and the twelfth would be the one that
 * quietly returned 500 for a validation error — or, worse, forgot the second
 * half of the permission check below.
 *
 * ## The two-key rule
 *
 * This module is one screen that reaches every app, so it must never become a
 * way around any app's own gate. Every operation is therefore authorized
 * TWICE, and `entityAccess` is the only place that is expressed:
 *
 *   1. the engine key — `data.export` / `data.import`, held by the member; and
 *   2. the entity's own key from the registry — `crm.export`, `menu.edit`,
 *      `ledger.post` — the same key the module's own screens are gated on.
 *
 * An owner holds everything, so nothing changes for them. A CRM manager
 * without `menu.edit` can export customers here and cannot import a menu, at
 * this route, for the same reason they cannot at `/api/menu/items`.
 *
 * Note what this file does NOT do: it never invents authorization. Both checks
 * go through `requirePermission` from `@/lib/auth`, so per-member overrides
 * apply exactly as they do everywhere else, and `api-guards.test.ts` sees a
 * real guard in every route that imports it.
