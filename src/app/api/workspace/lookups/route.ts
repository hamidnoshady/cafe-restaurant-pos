/**
 * The pickers every workspace form needs: the business's active members, its
 * parties, its live projects and the document files already in the Media
 * Library.
 *
 * Its own endpoint rather than reusing `/api/team` and `/api/parties` because
 * those two are gated on `team.manage` and `parties.view` — permissions an
 * editor on a construction project has no reason to hold. Naming the customer
 * a project is for must not require the right to edit the customer directory,
 * so this returns the minimum a picker needs (an id and a display name) behind
 * `workspace.view` and nothing more. No phone, no address, no financial block.
 *
 * The media list is here for the same reason and is the sharpest case:
 * the Media Library's own route is owner/manager-only because a file store is
 * back-office custody, but attaching an already-uploaded drawing to a task is
 * not. So this returns file names and ids only — no storage key, no signed
 * URL, no byte access. Uploading still goes through «رسانه» and its own gate.
