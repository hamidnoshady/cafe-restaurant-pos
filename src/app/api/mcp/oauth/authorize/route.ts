/**
 * The OAuth authorization endpoint.
 *
 * It authorizes nothing itself. It validates the request and then hands the
 * browser to `/mcp/consent`, which is an ordinary authenticated dashboard page —
 * so the owner signs in with the account they already have, on the origin they
 * already trust, and the "which scopes, which branch, apply or approve" decision
 * is made by a human looking at a screen rather than inferred from a query
 * string.
 *
 * The validation order is the security property here. `client_id` and
 * `redirect_uri` are checked *first*, and only once both are known-registered
 * does any other failure get redirected back to the client. The other way round,
 * this endpoint is an open redirect: anyone could hand it an arbitrary
 * `redirect_uri` plus a deliberately broken `response_type` and have this server
 * bounce a victim wherever they liked.
