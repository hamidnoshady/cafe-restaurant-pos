/**
 * Authenticated, tenant-origin-specific one-click installer for the Cafe POS
 * Windows Print Connector — the one hardware gateway for Windows printer
 * queues and network printers alike.
 *
 * The executable-looking download is a Windows command file containing only
 * built-in PowerShell setup code. It downloads the public connector source,
 * installs it per-user, starts it, and creates a Startup shortcut.
 *
 * The two addresses baked into it are *not* the same thing, and are resolved
 * independently:
 *
 *  - The connector's allowed origin(s): the browser-facing Cafe POS origin,
 *    taken from this request's host under the same host policy the tenant
 *    boundary uses (so it is already guaranteed to match the session's
 *    business), plus the business's other legitimate labels — the current
 *    subdomain and any rename aliases — so a renamed tenant's connector keeps
 *    working while bookmarks move over.
 *  - The connector's download URL: the stable platform base where the payload
 *    (a tenant-neutral file) actually lives — never an improvised tenant
 *    hostname. That separation is the fix for first-install failures where a
 *    tenant subdomain that the browser could resolve (DoH) could not be
 *    resolved by the Windows system resolver PowerShell uses.

  //    ROOT_DOMAIN. The request's Host header only gates reachability: it
  //    must BE one of those labels, checked again here rather than trusted,
  //    because an allowed origin is exactly what the connector will serve
  //    print jobs from. `window.location.origin` reaches the connector only
  //    through this server-side validation, never verbatim.
  //  - Host routing off (single-café, desktop, LAN installs): the only
  //    meaningful origin is the one the browser used to reach this kiosk —
  //    the request origin itself (localhost, an IP:port, the café's custom
  //    domain), which is the whole deployment.
