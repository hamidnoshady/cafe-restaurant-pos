/**
 * A person decides who an online shopper actually is.
 *
 * This is the only path on which an ambiguous external identity becomes a link
 * to a customer record, and the only path on which remote data is allowed to
 * overwrite a value the shop entered itself. Both are judgements about people,
 * so both require a human and both leave an audit row naming them.
 *
 * The five decisions:
 * - `link` — this shopper is that customer.
 * - `create` — nobody we have; make a record from what the store knows.
 * - `ignore` — not a customer of ours (a test order, a bot, a duplicate feed).
 * - `accept_conflicts` — the store's values are right; replace ours.
 * - `reject_conflicts` — ours are right; keep them and close the flag.
 *
 * Note what is absent: there is no "merge these two customers" action. Merge
 * is irreversible and lives behind its own screen with its own preview; a
 * reconciliation queue that could trigger one would be a destructive operation
 * hiding inside a routine one.
