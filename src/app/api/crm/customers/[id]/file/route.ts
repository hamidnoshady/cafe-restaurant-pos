/**
 * The 360° customer file (Phase 36) — the record plus its aggregates.
 *
 * The aggregates here are computed with the *same* "completed orders only,
 * bucketed by business day" rule the segment compiler uses, which is why they
 * are one service call rather than a few counts assembled in the page: a file
 * that says «۱۲ خرید» while the «حداقل ۱۲ خرید» segment excludes the customer
 * is a bug nobody can debug from the UI.
 *
 * Notes ride along because the file always shows them; the timeline does not,
 * because it is paginated and filtered separately.
