/**
 * Move the current session to another of this person's businesses.
 *
 * Re-issues the session cookie against the target membership, so the caller's
 * role, default branch and — through `getSession()` — the tenant scope every
 * subsequent query runs under all change together. No re-authentication is
 * needed: the person already proved who they are, and the membership lookup
 * below is what proves they belong to the business they asked for.
 *
 * A PIN-only member has no platform identity and so has nothing to switch to.
 *
 * **Being retired (Phase 21).** Once each business has its own origin this
 * endpoint is exactly the thing the wave removes: it mints, on business A's
 * host, a cookie valid for business B. Under `SUBDOMAIN_ROUTING=on` it refuses
 * — a person with several memberships signs in on each business's own host,
 * finding them through the apex directory. The handler stays for the one
 * release the path-prefix mode is still supported, and is deleted in Wave 4
 * along with the rewrite itself.
