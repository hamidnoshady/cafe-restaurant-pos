/**
 * PIN quick-login for Cashier/Waiter/Kitchen.
 *
 * PINs are unique per business (migration 0020 moved that uniqueness down from
 * the whole table), so (business, pin) identifies one member; passing a
 * locationId narrows it further on a multi-branch business.
 *
 * Phase 20 Wave 2 — the redesigned login picks an employee by name first
 * (`pin-login/roster`), so `employeeId` narrows the lookup to that one row
 * instead of scanning every PIN-role member; omitting it keeps the original
 * bcrypt-scan behaviour for any caller that still only sends a PIN. Either
 * way, a successful match also mints a server-side `employee_sessions` row
 * (Wave 1) *alongside* the existing JWT — the JWT stays the bearer credential
 * in the cookie, the DB row exists so the session can be listed/revoked and
 * so a revocation takes effect immediately (see checkEmployeeSession in
 * auth.ts) rather than waiting for the JWT's own expiry.
 *
 * Phase 42 — the PIN is no longer the whole story. Once the business's
 * phone-OTP adoption window has closed (`auth.phoneOtp`, see
 * phone-otp-policy.ts), a correct PIN alone does not mint a session: the
 * member must also hold a verified phone number and have verified by OTP
 * within the last 7 days. Outside that window the response carries a
 * ten-minute `phone_pending` token instead of a cookie, and the client walks
 * the member through the OTP step (`/api/auth/phone-otp/*`); the very same
 * response shape is used *inside* the window when the member asked to verify
 * their number proactively (`verifyPhone: true` — the door's «تأیید شمارهٔ
 * موبایل» button), which is how staff spend the 14-day adoption window
 * without an OTP being forced on them yet.
