/**
 * The apex host's "which business?" router (Phase 23 Wave 3).
 *
 * Under subdomain routing every business has its own origin, so a person with
 * memberships in several needs somewhere to find out which host to go to. The
 * apex `pos.eshobe.com` is that somewhere, and this is what it asks.
 *
 * It mints no session and sets no cookie — that is the point. A session is
 * only ever created on the business's own origin, which is what makes the
 * cookie host-scoped there. This route answers a question and hands back
 * links; the visitor then logs in again on the host they pick.
 *
 * **It asks for the password even though it authenticates nothing.** The plan
 * for this wave described an email-only lookup, and email-only would make this
 * an open account-enumeration oracle: type any address, learn whether it has
 * memberships and at which businesses, from an unauthenticated public origin.
 * Requiring the password costs the visitor one field they were about to type
 * anyway, and matches what /api/auth/login already does — it, too, reveals the
 * business list only after the password checks out. A wave whose whole purpose
 * is tightening the tenant boundary should not open a directory next to it.
