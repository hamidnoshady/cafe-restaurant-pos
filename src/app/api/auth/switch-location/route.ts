/**
 * Moves the session's active branch to another one the member can reach.
 *
 * Re-issues the session cookie with `activeLocationId` set, so the tenant
 * scope (business) is untouched but every screen that resolves the caller's
 * branch via `resolveActiveLocation` picks up the new one on the very next
 * request — there is nothing else to invalidate.
 *
 * Role and branch assignment are re-read from the database rather than
 * trusted from the token, matching `requirePermission`: a membership's
 * assignment can change after login, and this is the one request where using
 * a stale token's role would let someone switch into a branch they were just
 * unassigned from.
