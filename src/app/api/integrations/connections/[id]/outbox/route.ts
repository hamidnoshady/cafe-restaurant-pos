/**
 * The outbox as a queue manager: every row waiting on (or recently finished
 * for) one connection, newest first — what kind of work it is, its status,
 * how many attempts it has made, and the last error if it is failing.
 *
 * The same rows serve both connection modes, which is what makes one screen
 * able to show both: in `rest_api` mode the app drains them itself on its
 * background tick, in `plugin` mode they are leased and applied by the
 * WordPress plugin on its next run. When the plugin is not running — stale
 * `last_plugin_seen_at`, WP-Cron never firing — this list is exactly what
 * shows the work sitting there and why.
