/**
 * Owner-only management of the business's public API keys — the credential
 * `/api/v1/*` authenticates.
 *
 * Gated on `api_platform` explicitly rather than through `featureForApiPath`:
 * that map keys off the request path, and this route is under
 * `/api/connections` (which must stay ungated, because the desktop-pairing
 * panel next to it is not something a business buys). The public API surface
 * itself checks the same flag inside `withApiKeyScope`, so a business that
 * loses the entitlement both stops being able to mint keys and stops being
 * able to use the ones it has.
 *
 * Owner-only, not `settings.manage`: a key is a long-lived machine credential
 * that reads orders, menu, inventory and reports for a whole branch.
