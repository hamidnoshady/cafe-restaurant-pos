/**
 * Owner-only management of this business's MCP connections — the credential
 * `/api/mcp` authenticates.
 *
 * Owner-only, not `settings.manage`, for the same reason the API-keys route is:
 * this hands a program continuous access to a whole branch's orders, stock,
 * customers and ledger, and (with `pos.write`) the ability to change them.
 *
 * Gated on `api_platform` explicitly rather than through `featureForApiPath`,
 * because that map keys off the request path and this route sits under
 * `/api/connections`, which must stay ungated — the desktop-pairing panel beside
 * it is not something a business buys. The MCP surface itself re-checks the same
 * flag inside `withMcpScope`, so losing the entitlement stops both minting new
 * connections and using existing ones.
