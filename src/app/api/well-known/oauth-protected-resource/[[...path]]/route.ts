/**
 * RFC 9728 — protected resource metadata, served at
 * `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (see the rewrites in
 * `next.config.ts`; Next's app router will not serve a dot-prefixed folder).
 *
 * The optional catch-all matters: RFC 9728 tells a client to look for the
 * document at the resource's *path-inserted* location — for a resource at
 * `/api/mcp`, that is `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/api/mcp` — while
 * plenty of clients (and every hand-written curl) try the bare path first. Both
 * answer the same document rather than one of them 404ing, because a 404 here is
 * indistinguishable to a client from "this server does not support OAuth", and
 * the connector then silently fails to add.
 *
 * Session-less and public by necessity: this is what a client reads *before* it
 * has any credential. It discloses nothing but URLs that are already implied by
 * the hostname.
