 * The WordPress & WooCommerce manager's layout — one of the two managers

 *
 * The app boundary (role, sidebar) is the parent's; what belongs here is the
 * half of the app that is *entitlement-gated*. The `integrations` flag is
 * applied at this manager's boundary only, as a locked preview: a business
 * without the add-on still opens the app and still runs the platform site it
 * pays for — it is the WordPress half that becomes an inert product preview
 * until the entitlement is granted. The child panels also skip their API
 * calls in that state.
