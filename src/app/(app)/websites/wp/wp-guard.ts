/**
 * The role line every page of the WordPress manager stands behind — written
 * once, from the same rule the menu is filtered by.
 *
 * All nine pages of this manager opened with the identical four lines: fetch
 * the session, bounce to `/login` without one, then a hand-inlined
 * `role !== "owner" && role !== "manager"` bounce to `/dashboard`. Nine copies
 * of a rule that already existed as a function — `canViewWpSection`, which was
 * exported, documented as "the role gate", and called by nothing. So the menu
 * and the pages agreed only by coincidence: widening the gate in the one place
 * that looked like the source of truth would have opened the menu entries
 * while every page behind them still redirected away.
 *
 * The guard stays on the pages rather than being left to `layout.tsx` alone.
 * A layout guard is real, but Next renders layouts and pages in parallel and a
 * page is its own entry point, so each one re-checking is the defence in depth
 * the rest of this codebase keeps — one *rule*, checked in every place, rather
 * than one place trusted by eight others.
 *
 * Returns the session, so a caller that needs the business id or the role does
 * not fetch it twice.
