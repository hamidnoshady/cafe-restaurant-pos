/**
 * «مدیریت وب‌سایت» — the app's two managers and their sections.
 *
 * The app answers one question for a business — "where does my website live,
 * and how do I run it?" — and there are exactly two answers today:
 *
 *   cms — the platform's own site builder (Eshobe CMS, a separate deployment
 *         this app holds one encrypted credential for; see
 *         docs/eshobe-cms-integration.md).
 *   wp  — a WordPress/WooCommerce site the business already runs, managed
 *         through the plugin or the REST API (Phase 40).
 *
 * They are peers and they never merge: a section of one is never rendered
 * inside the other, and neither is a tab of the technical connections hub.
 * What this module owns is the *routing* half of that — which sections exist,
 * what their URLs are, who may open them, and (the part that is new) **which
 * of them a business actually sees**, which depends on the connections it has
 * made rather than on a flag somebody set.
 *
 * That last rule is why `visibleSections` takes a state rather than a role
 * alone. A business with no site at all should be offered the two ways to get
 * one and nothing else — a «سفارش‌ها» menu entry over a site that does not
 * exist is a dead end with a number on it. Once a manager is connected, its
 * whole menu appears.
 *
 * Framework-free (no React, no db, no next) so the rule is unit-tested in
 * `website-routes.test.ts` and can be imported by the server layout, the
 * client sidebar and the app home alike — the same split `crm-routes.ts` and
 * `growth-routes.ts` keep.
