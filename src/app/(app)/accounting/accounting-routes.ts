 * The Accounting app's section routing.

 * (`?tab=` targets), then under `/dashboard/accounting`. It is now a real app
 * at its own top-level public prefix — `/accounting/…`, a real route directory
 * under `src/app/(app)/accounting`, not a middleware rewrite — with one route
 * per section, so an accounting section is a URL a person can bookmark, share
 * and pin.
 *
 * These keys are the one source of truth for the app's menu
 * (`accounting-nav.ts` labels them and draws their role line), for the
 * server-side gate on each page, and for the legacy `?tab=` redirects
 * (`/dashboard/ledger` still forwards here so old bookmarks, saved bottom-nav
 * slots and knowledge-base articles never become dead ends).
