/**
 * One glyph per Accounting section.
 *
 * Split out of `accounting-manager.tsx` when the app got a sidebar of its own:
 * the in-page rail and the app's main menu draw the same sections, and two
 * icon maps over one list is how the same section ends up with two faces. The
 * *list* still lives in `accounting-nav.ts` (framework-free, server-readable);
 * this is the client-side presentation half, keyed by the same union so a new
 * section cannot be added without giving it a glyph.
