/**
 * The pieces every ledger section repeats — extracted so they are written once.
 *
 * The accounting app grew screen by screen, and three shapes ended up
 * hand-rolled again and again, one copy per file:
 *
 *  - the **failed-load card** («تلاش دوباره» over a destructive wash) — A/R,
 *    A/P and the statement panels each had their own;
 *  - the **ISO-or-dash Jalali date** (`fmtJalali`) — «دریافت و پرداخت» and
 *    «اقساط» each carried a private copy of the same three lines;
 *  - the **fixed-position overlay** — backdrop, `<section role="dialog"
 *    aria-modal>`, click-to-close, Escape-to-close — spelled out in ten files,
 *    which is how one of them ended up closing on Escape *while its POST was
 *    still in flight* and another forgot the busy guard entirely.
 *
 * They live together here because they are used together: a ledger overlay
 * almost always shows a Jalali date and can fail to load. `OverlayDialog`
 * composes `use-overlay-escape.tsx` (the hook the hand-rolled panels already
 * shared) rather than re-implementing it, and stays presentation-only — no
 * focus trapping, no scroll locking, exactly the plain panel these screens
 * already were. A panel that needs the full dialog behaviour uses the shadcn
 * `<Dialog>` the cheques register uses instead.
