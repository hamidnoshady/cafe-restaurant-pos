/**
 * The complete Accounting workspace menu — what «حسابداری» actually contains.
 *
 * The problem this file exists to fix: Accounting *was* the whole ledger and
 * nothing else. Opening it dropped you straight into «فضای کار حسابداری» —
 * تراز آزمایشی، دفتر روزنامه، اسناد، اشخاص، دریافت و پرداخت — while everything
 * a business does that the ledger then records (فروش و فاکتور، خرید و انبار،
 * محصولات، گزارش‌ها، عملیات صنف) lived in a *second* main menu at
 * `/dashboard/*`. Two competing "main" navigations for one product, and the
 * one called «حسابداری» was the narrower of the two.
 *
 * So Accounting is the primary workspace, and the ledger is a named group
 * inside it. Concretely:
 *
 *  - the **work areas** (sales, purchases, inventory, products, reports, the
 *    trade's own operational screens) are the business nav entries that
 *    already exist. They are *picked out of* the list the shell already built
 *    — `navItems`, with every module / role / feature / permission filter
 *    already applied — and never re-declared here. A business whose trade has
 *    no انبار has no انبار row, because the entry was never in the list.
 *  - the **ledger sections** are `ACCOUNTING_SECTIONS`, unchanged, gathered
 *    into one group called «فضای کار حسابداری» so the words on the screen
 *    match the words in the product.
 *
 * Framework-free (no React, no JSX, no icons) like `accounting-nav.ts` beside
 * it, so the same composition is testable and can be read by the server nav
 * builder as well as by the client sidebar.
