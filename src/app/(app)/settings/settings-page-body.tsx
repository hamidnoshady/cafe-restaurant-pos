/**
 * What every platform settings URL renders.
 *
 * The area is many routes now — `/settings`, `/settings/team`,
 * `/settings/printers` — and all of them need the same four reads (the
 * member's row, the business's features, its industry, the resulting visible
 * tabs) before they can decide what the member may see. Keeping that in one
 * body rather than in each page means a new section cannot come with a
 * slightly different gate.
 *
 * The gate itself is unchanged and deliberately strict: a section the member's
 * permissions do not include is not rendered read-only, it redirects — to the
 * first section they *can* open, or out of settings entirely when there is
 * none. A URL nobody may open must never become a 404 either, which is why the
 * unknown-section case lands on the settings home rather than falling through.
 *
 * This is the *platform's* settings. Each app's settings are the app's own
 * pages (`/accounting/settings` and friends); nothing here is ever rendered
 * inside an app, and no app links to a `?tab=` of this page in place of having
 * settings of its own.
