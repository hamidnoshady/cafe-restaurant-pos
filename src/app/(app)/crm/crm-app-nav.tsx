/**
 * The CRM app's own main sidebar (Phase 36).
 *
 * Rendered in the dashboard's app slot for every route under `/crm` —
 * `src/lib/app-shells.ts` is the rule that hands the slot over.
 *
 * The *arrangement* is `AppSectionNav`, shared with Growth: two apps in the
 * same platform whose menus behaved differently would be two products, and
 * that used to be guaranteed only by two identical copies of the same markup
 * sitting in two files. What is CRM's own — its sections, its href function,
 * its active-state rule and the name a screen reader announces — is all that
 * is left here.
