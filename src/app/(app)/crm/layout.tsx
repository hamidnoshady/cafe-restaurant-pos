 * The CRM app's layout (Phase 36).
 *
 * The role gate is here, server-side, so a member the app does not admit never
 * renders a single CRM screen — the per-page checks below it are the finer
 * cut (a cashier may open the directory but not the pipeline), not the door.
 *
 * `canOpenCrm` is derived from the same `canViewCrmSection` the menu uses, so
 * "who is let in" and "what they see once inside" cannot disagree: anyone with
 * at least one visible section is admitted, and everyone else is not.
