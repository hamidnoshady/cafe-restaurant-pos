/**
 * Phase 21 Wave 7 — item lifecycle events, for the audit trail on
 * high-value goods.
 *
 * A weighed gold piece or a serialized watch is worth more than most of
 * what this system tracks, and "who changed its cost basis, and when" is a
 * real question an auditor asks. Sales and repairs already leave a record
 * (they post through the domain-event engine); intake and edits did not,
 * because they have no ledger effect.
 *
 * They do not need one. The engine already handles an event with no
 * registered posting rule by recording it and posting nothing — a
 * deliberate design point since Wave 1 ("not every domain event has a
 * ledger effect") — so these lifecycle events use exactly the same log,
 * and `itemAuditTrail` (industry-reports-service.ts) reads posted and
 * unposted events back as one timeline.
 *
 * Called from route handlers rather than from the services themselves,
 * because it is the request that knows *who* acted and which business they
 * acted for; the item services take neither.
