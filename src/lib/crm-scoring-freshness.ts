/**
 * Keeping RFM scores fresh, in the background.
 *
 * ## Why this is a job and not a hook
 *
 * An RFM score is a **whole-population** property: a customer is in the top
 * recency quintile only relative to everyone else. So one customer buying
 * something does not change one score — in principle it shifts the quintile
 * boundaries for the entire customer base.
 *
 * There are three ways to handle that, and two of them are wrong:
 *
 * 1. **Rescore on checkout.** Fatally wrong. It puts a full-table aggregation
 *    over every customer and every order on the critical path of taking money.
 *    On a busy Friday with 20k customers, the till waits for a report. Worse,
 *    a failure in a *reporting* calculation would fail the *sale* — the
 *    customer is standing there with a card in their hand and the CRM's
 *    analytics broke the payment.
 * 2. **Rescore on read.** Subtly wrong. Scores would change between two page
 *    loads while an owner was looking at them, and every viewer would pay for
 *    a full population scan.
 * 3. **Mark dirty on change; rescore on a timer.** What this module does.
 *
 * ## Staleness is visible, not hidden
 *
 * `crm_scoring_state` records when the data last changed (`dirty_since`), when
 * scoring last ran, and whether it worked. The UI shows the age of the numbers
 * rather than implying they are live. A day-old score labelled «به‌روزرسانی:
 * دیروز» is honest and useful; the same score presented as current is a lie
 * that nobody can detect.
 *
 * A failure is recorded and surfaced, never swallowed. Scores that silently
 * stopped updating three weeks ago are worse than no scores, because decisions
 * get made on them.

 *
 * ## Why a timestamp comparison and not an equality check
 *
 * The obvious implementation — remember `dirty_since`, clear it if it has not
 * changed — does not work across this boundary. Postgres stores `timestamptz`
 * with microsecond precision; a value round-tripped through a JavaScript
 * `Date` has milliseconds. `2026-09-20T11:16:35.277333Z` comes back as
 * `…277Z`, so the equality never holds, the flag is never cleared, and the
 * business is rescored on every single tick forever. That is a slow, silent,
 * expensive failure, and it is exactly what the first version of this did.
 *
 * Comparing against the run's own start time avoids the round trip entirely
 * and expresses the actual intent.
