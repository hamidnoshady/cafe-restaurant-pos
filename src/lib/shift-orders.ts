/**
 * Item-by-item order detail for the current shift — the framework-free half.
 *
 * The reporting views (Phase 8, migration 0008) all aggregate: the finest
 * grain any of them expose is "one menu item per business day"
 * (v_menu_item_performance). Reviewing a shift order by order needs the
 * transactional rows themselves, so this pairs with shift-orders-service.ts
 * the same way reports.ts pairs with reports-service.ts — the grouping rule
 * lives here and is unit tested; the query lives there.
 *
 * What a reviewed order carries is deliberately the *whole* bill, not a
 * summary of it: every line's add-ons by name and price, its note and void
 * reason, the money breakdown down to discount/service charge/tax/tip, and
 * how it was tendered. Reviewing a shift is the one place someone is asked
 * "why was this order this much?", and an answer that omits the add-ons — the
 * part of a bill customers dispute most often — sends the reviewer to the
 * orders screen to re-read the same order there.
 *
 * A line's amount reuses computeLineSubtotal (orders.ts) rather than
 * recomputing "(unit price + modifiers) × quantity" a second time, so this
 * report can never disagree with what the cashier was charged. It is a
 * *pre-discount* line amount: an order's discount is applied at the order
 * level, and only the order total reflects it.
