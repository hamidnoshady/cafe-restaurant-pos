/**
 * The signed-in member's effective access — one server-side read.
 *
 * Three pages used to carry their own copy of "SELECT role, permissions FROM
 * users …" plus the `effectivePermissions(parseOverrides(…))` resolution beside
 * it (the settings body, the workspace shell, the orders page), and every new
 * page that needed to gate a button by permission would have grown a fourth.
 * Copies of a security-relevant read are how one screen says «شما مجوز دارید»
 * while the route behind it says 403.
 *
 * The read runs inside an explicit `withTenant` scope, never the ambient one
 * `getSession()` sets: that scope was applied with `enterWith()`, which does not
 * survive a concurrent `withTenant()`/`withoutTenantScope()` `run()` call
 * elsewhere in the process, so an ambient-scope read can come back empty
 * non-deterministically — see the withTenantScope doc comment in auth.ts.
 *
 * Framework-free apart from `db`/`next` types: server components and route
 * handlers both call it; nothing client-side ever sees it.
