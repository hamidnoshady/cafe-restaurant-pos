 * The split is the same one the rest of `src/lib` uses: every query lives

 * stays unit-testable against fixtures and this file stays a list of SELECTs.
 *
 * Everything is read inside the caller's tenant scope, so RLS is the boundary
 * exactly as it is in a request. A query that fails (a table a future release
 * drops, a permission edge) degrades that one rule to "found nothing" rather
 * than taking the whole review down — a review that half-runs is far more
 * useful than one that errors, and each rule is independent by construction.
