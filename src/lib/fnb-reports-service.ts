/**
 * Phase 27 Wave 12 — read-only F&B waste analytics.
 *
 * Waste is already a posting fact: the waste route writes a `waste`
 * stock_movement and posts Debit wasteExpense / Credit inventory. This just
 * reads those back — no new posting, no new table — and cross-checks the
 * movement total against the waste expense account's ledger balance for the
 * same period, so the two can never silently disagree.
