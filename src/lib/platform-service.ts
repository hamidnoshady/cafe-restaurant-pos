/**
 * Phase 15 — the read/write operations behind the super-admin console.

 * impossible — from a tenant session: listing every business, reading any
 * business's usage, minting an impersonation session into a business the
 * operator is not a member of.
 *
 * DB-touching, so no direct unit test per repo convention; the pure decisions
 * they lean on (capability presets, impersonation clamping) live in
 * `platform-admin.ts` and are tested there, and the guard/isolation behaviour
 * is exercised by the platform integration test.
