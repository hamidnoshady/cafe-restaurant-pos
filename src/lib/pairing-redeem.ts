/**
 * The request half of pairing-code redemption, shared by the two URLs that
 * expose it.
 *
 * There are two because of where the credential is now issued. Redemption has
 * always lived under `/api/platform/pairing/redeem`, and middleware moves
 * *anything* under `/api/platform` to the console's own host — correct for the
 * console, wrong here: since an owner can issue a desktop code from their own
 * dashboard, the address they hand the desktop app is their own business
 * origin (`biz1.example.com`), and pairing against it would bounce through a
 * cross-host redirect before it ever reached a handler. `/api/pairing/redeem`
 * is the same exchange with no `/api/platform` prefix, so it answers on
 * whatever origin the owner copied.
 *
 * The old URL stays, unchanged in behaviour: every desktop build already
 * shipped points at it, and `/api/setup/pair` still falls back to it when a
 * cloud server is too old to serve the new one.
