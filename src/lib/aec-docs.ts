/**
 * Issue #799 §9 and §12 — the document-control domain's pure half: document
 * types, disciplines, issue purposes, revision and transmittal statuses, the
 * transition rules, and the two small pieces of arithmetic a drawing register
 * needs (what the next revision is called, and whether everybody who must sign
 * for a transmittal has signed).
 *
 * Everything here is data or a small function over it, with no database and no
 * framework, for the same reason `aec.ts` and `aec-boq.ts` are pure: the client
 * panel needs the labels and the same rules the service applies, and it must not
 * drag `pg` in with them.
 *
 * ## Two decisions worth reading twice
 *
 *   * **A discipline is an AEC specialty, not a second vocabulary.** §9's
 *     "discipline" is exactly the set of disciplines a business already declares
 *     in `AEC_SPECIALTIES` (architecture, structural, MEP, surveying, …), so the
 *     labels are imported rather than restated. A second list would be a second
 *     place to forget one.
 *   * **The revision code is a label, the revision number is the order.** A
 *     drawing office writes «01», «A» or «C2» in the title block, and the two
 *     are genuinely different choices; the register keeps both, orders by the
 *     number, and suggests a letter only as a default.
