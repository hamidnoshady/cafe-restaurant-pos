/**
 * The platform settings area's URLs.
 *
 * «تنظیمات» used to be one page with an in-page rail and a `?tab=` parameter,
 * which meant the whole platform settings area had a single address: a member
 * could not bookmark «تیم», a link in a guide could only point at the page and
 * hope, and an app's settings link had nothing more specific to aim at than
 * the whole thing. Each section is a real URL now — `/settings/team`,
 * `/settings/security` — and the rail navigates between them.
 *
 * Two kinds of entry live here:
 *
 *  - the tabs of the settings manager (`settings-tabs.ts`, `SETTINGS_TAB_KEYS`), whose
 *    slug is usually their key; `security` and `sync` are shorter, friendlier
 *    spellings of keys the code already had.
 *  - the platform sections that are **not** tabs — the member's own profile,
 *    platform billing, the subscription, the technical connections hub. They
 *    are listed here too because the point of this table is to answer "is this
 *    URL part of platform settings, and what is it called", which the sidebar,
 *    the middleware tests and every app's settings page all ask.
 *
 * What is emphatically *not* here: an app's own settings. `/accounting/settings`,
 * `/growth/settings`, `/crm/settings` and `/websites/settings` are the apps'
 * own routes with their own components (see `APP_SETTINGS_HREFS` in
 * `app-routes.ts`). Keeping the two tables apart is what makes "an app's
 * settings page must never be the platform settings page" checkable.
 *
 * Framework-free, so the Edge middleware, the server pages and the client rail
 * all read the same rules.
