/**
 * Phase 25 Wave 2 — what a business's industry actually changes about the app.
 *
 * Phase 21 gave each industry its own chart of accounts, item model, posting
 * rules, wizard path and dashboard page — but the *shell* stayed café-shaped.
 * `businesses.industry` only ever added: it revealed the three industry pages
 * and nothing else, while every F&B module (میزها، آشپزخانه، رزروها، منو، …)
 * was gated on feature flags that no industry turns off, and every label was a
 * literal in the component that rendered it. A jewellery shop got the whole
 * café app with a "طلا و جواهر" tab bolted on and a sidebar reading
 * «کافه و رستوران».
 *
 * This is the one place that answers "what does this industry get, and what is
 * it called". It is the industry-keyed counterpart of `features.ts` — a
 * disabled module is refused at the API guard, not merely hidden from the nav —
 * and the generalisation of the pattern `wizard-steps.ts` already used for the
 * setup wizard's steps.
 *
 * Framework-free (no `db`, no `next`) exactly like `industries.ts` and
 * `wizard-steps.ts`, so client components and Edge code can import it directly.
 * The DB-touching half — resolving a business's industry and enforcing the
 * module set — lives in `industry-guard.ts`.
 *
 * Note this is **not** an i18n layer and should not grow into one. It carries
 * only the handful of nouns that genuinely differ between trades; everything
 * else stays a literal where it is rendered.
