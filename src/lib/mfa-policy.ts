/**
 * Phase 24 Wave 2 — the per-business two-factor policy.
 *
 * Exactly one knob today, and deliberately so: the spec says a business "may
 * opt to extend the requirement to `manager`; off by default", and nothing
 * more. `owner` is not a knob — the requirement on the full permission set is
 * the point of the wave and is not negotiable per tenant.
 *
 * Read on the login path, where no session exists yet and the business has
 * only just been chosen, so it takes an explicit `businessId` and runs under
 * the caller's scope rather than fetching one of its own.
