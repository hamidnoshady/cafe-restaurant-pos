/**
 * Phase 35 Wave 5 — tool routing by app.
 *
 * `src/lib/ai-tools.ts` is 1278 lines of tool definitions, and ALL of them
 * are sent every turn. For "how much did we sell yesterday?" the gold weight,
 * watch repair and cosmetics batch-expiry tools go along for the ride.
 *
 * This module maps tools to apps, so a turn that only touches Accounting sends
 * only sales tools + the always-on set. Three guards protect against
 * misrouting:
 *
 * 1. Always-on tools are never filtered out.
 * 2. An uncertain router sends everything (fallback to today's behavior).
 * 3. The router's own cost is counted in the turn's settlement.
 *
 * Framework-free (no `db`, no `next`).
