 * see postExactOrderPaymentEntry/postExactPurchaseEntry in ledger-service.ts),
 * so there is no per-invoice/per-bill "amount still open" already tracked
 * anywhere. Aging has to reconstruct it: given a party's open items
 * (invoices owed to the business, or bills the business owes) and the
 * payments recorded against their balance, apply the payments FIFO against
 * the oldest open items first and see what's left of each one as of a date.
 *
 * DB orchestration (fetching the lines, resolving customer/supplier names)
 * lives in ar-service.ts/ap-service.ts and is not unit-tested directly, per
 * repo convention.
