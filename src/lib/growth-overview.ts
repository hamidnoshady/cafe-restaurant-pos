/**
 * Phase 36b — the Growth & Marketing app's dashboard query.
 *
 * Loyalty, campaigns/gift cards and commission each already had a service and
 * a report (`loyalty-service.ts`, `promotions-service.ts`,
 * `commission-service.ts`), and each already posted to the ledger through the
 * domain-event engine — but nothing could answer the owner's actual question,
 * «بازاریابی‌ام چه خبر؟», in one place. The three facts lived on three flat
 * pages, and the liabilities they created were only visible inside accounting.
 *
 * This file is that one place. It reads only existing tables — no new ledger
 * writes, no second source of truth for any number: every balance in the
 * "bridge" is reconstructed from `journal_lines` the same way the trial
 * balance reconstructs it, because a marketing dashboard that disagrees with
 * the books is worse than no dashboard.
 *
 * Windows are rolling 30-day ranges over the stored Gregorian ISO date
 * convention, labelled in the UI as «۳۰ روز گذشته» — deliberately not a
 * calendar month, so the number means the same thing on any day it is opened.
