 * statement dates are acceptable, how a cleared line signs into the running
 * total, and what «مغایرت» is. The DB-touching half
 * (`reconciliation-service.ts`) consults this before it writes anything, and
 * the screen (`reconciliation-section.tsx`) uses the same functions to decide
 * what to show — so the number under «مغایرت» and the number the server
 * refuses to complete on are computed by one piece of code, not two that
 * agree by accident.
 *
 * Split out for the reason `cheques.ts` was split out of `cheques-service.ts`:
 * per this repo's convention a DB-touching module has no direct unit test, so
 * the rules worth asserting have to live somewhere a unit test can reach. Its
 * tests are `bank-reconciliation.test.ts`.
