/**
 * The tool catalogue an MCP client sees.
 *
 * The read half is **not** written here. It is the assistant's own read tools
 * (`toolDefinitions("dashboard")` in `ai.ts`, executed by `runReadTool` in
 * `ai-tools.ts`), reshaped into MCP's tool descriptor. That is the whole point:
 * a question Claude asks over MCP and the same question asked in «دستیار» must
 * be answered by the same code reading the same views, or the two surfaces
 * start disagreeing about last week's revenue — and only one of them is in the
 * room to be corrected. Adding a read tool to `ai.ts` adds it here for free.
 *
 * Two things are added on top:
 *
 *   * **An English line.** The in-app assistant is prompted in Persian and
 *     talks to a Persian owner, so its descriptions are Persian only. An MCP
 *     client may be driving a model that is reasoning in English about a
 *     Persian business, and a tool it cannot read is a tool it will not call.
 *     Each tool therefore gets one English sentence *in front of* the Persian
 *     one — never instead of it, because the Persian text carries the domain
 *     rules ("بازهٔ پیش‌فرض ۳۰ روز", "شناسه را از کاربر نپرس").
 *   * **The write half**, built from `ACTION_CATALOG` — every action that has a
 *     server-side executor and is not `coworkerOnly`. See `MCP_WRITE_TOOLS`.
 *
 * Pure. Executing a tool is `server.ts`'s job; this file only says what exists.
