/**
 * The background ticks must claim their work under the platform bypass.
 *
 * ## Why this test exists — the bug it was written for
 *
 * A background tick has no session, so it inherits no tenant scope. Every
 * table this engine owns is protected by an RLS policy keyed on
 * `app.business_id` (migration 0168), and an unset scope makes
 * `app_current_business()` NULL, which makes every policy predicate false.
 * A cross-tenant claim issued with no scope therefore matches **zero rows on
 * every business**: the import queue never drains, and no error is raised —
 * the UPDATE honestly reports that it updated nothing.
 *
 * The reason this needs a *unit* test, and could never have been caught by the
 * integration suite, is that the integration database connects as a superuser.
 * Superusers ignore RLS outright, so the unscoped claim works perfectly there
 * and fails totally in production, where `npm run db:app-role` provisions the
 * unprivileged role that `assertRlsEffective` insists on at boot. That is the
 * worst shape a defect can have: green everywhere except where it matters.
 *
 * So the property is asserted structurally instead — the claim runs inside
 * `withoutTenantScope`, and the per-business work runs inside `withTenant`.
 * Mocking the database is what makes the *scope* observable, which is the
 * thing under test; the behaviour of the queue itself is covered against a
 * real Postgres in `integration/data-transfer.integration.test.ts`.
