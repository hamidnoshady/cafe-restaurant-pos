 * mapping screen can import it, and so the registry itself is unit-testable
 * without a fixture.
 *
 * The one idea worth stating: an ENTITY is described once — its fields, their
 * types, which are required, how they validate, what they relate to, how a
 * duplicate is recognised, and which permission reads or writes them — and
 * both directions are derived from that description. There is no separate
 * "CRM import" and "POS import"; there is one engine and a registry of
 * entities, which is what stops the fourth copy of a CSV parser from ever
 * being written.
