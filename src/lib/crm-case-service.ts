/**
 * Service cases and their response clock — «تیکت‌های خدمات».
 *
 * ## The one thing this gets right that naive SLA tracking gets wrong
 *
 * A case's age is not the time since it was opened. Some of that time was
 * spent **waiting on the customer**: the team asked for the order number, or a
 * photo of the damaged item, and then nothing happened for four days because
 * the customer was on holiday.
 *
 * If that time counts against the response target, three bad things follow:
 *
 * 1. Every report says the team is failing when it is not, so the reports get
 *    ignored — which costs more than never having built them.
 * 2. The fastest way to protect the number becomes *not asking the customer
 *    anything*, which is the opposite of good service.
 * 3. The genuinely-breached cases — the ones actually sitting on somebody's
 *    desk untouched — are buried among false positives and nobody finds them.
 *
 * So `waiting` time is accumulated into `waiting_seconds` and subtracted. The
 * clock a team is judged on runs only while the ball is in the team's court.
 * That is also why the accumulator is a stored total rather than something
 * derived at read time: a case can bounce between waiting and active a dozen
 * times, and reconstructing that from a status column is impossible — the
 * column only knows where the case is now.
 *
 * ## First response is separate from resolution
 *
 * `first_response_at` is stamped once and never moved. "Somebody acknowledged
 * me" and "my problem is fixed" are different promises with different targets,
 * and collapsing them hides the case that got a fast reply and then sat for
 * two weeks.
