/**
 * The CRM app's shared, framework-free vocabulary.
 *
 * `crm-service.ts` and friends read the database; the app's screens are client
 * components. Anything both halves need — the pipeline stages, the activity
 * and ticket taxonomies, the timeline's event kinds, the consent rules, the
 * money/label conventions the assistant's tools also follow — lives here, so a
 * client import never drags `pg` into the browser. Same posture as
 * `growth-shared.ts` beside `growth-overview.ts`, and `promotions.ts` beside
 * `promotions-service.ts`.
 *
 * Every enum in this file carries its own Persian label. That is Phase 33's
 * rule and it is load-bearing for the assistant: a tool that returns
 * `status: "in_progress"` gives the model nothing but an English token to
 * guess at, and a guess about what a status *means* is the kind of confident
 * wrongness that makes an owner stop trusting the feature. The label is a fact
 * the tool returns, not a translation the model performs.

// Deals — the pipeline
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Why a POS has a pipeline at all.
 *
 * The CRM issue (#367) ruled a deal pipeline out of scope with a good
 * argument: «مشتری خرید می‌کند، نه اینکه در قیف پیش برود» — a walk-in buys a
 * coffee, they do not progress through stages. That is exactly right for the
 * counter, and it is why nothing in the sales path touches this model.
 *
 * It stops being right the moment the sale is not a walk-in: a jeweller
 * quoting a custom ring, a café bidding for an office's weekly catering, a
 * watch shop holding a piece for a customer who is deciding. Those are
 * multi-day, multi-conversation sales with a real probability of not
 * happening, and today they live in a WhatsApp thread and the owner's memory.
 *
 * So the pipeline is here, but it is deliberately **not** wired into the
 * ledger: winning a deal records *no* revenue and posts *no* journal entry.
 * Revenue exists when an order or invoice is settled through the existing
 * sales path, which already posts correctly. A pipeline that also booked
 * revenue would be a second, unreconciled source of truth for the same money —
 * the one thing this codebase's accounting rules never permit. Won deals
 * therefore link *to* an order rather than replacing one.
