/**
 * Pure cart-line operations for the till.
 *
 * Every quantity change honours the one ceiling the server enforces
 * (order-quantity.ts): the steppers cannot build a line the submit would
 * reject, and a merge that would overflow the ceiling stays two lines
 * instead — each one legal on its own.
 *
 * The till.*
 * A cart line is *one configuration* of a menu item — a given menu item can sit
 * on several lines, one per distinct add-on/note combination. «دو قهوه، یکی با
 * شکلات و یکی بدون آن» is therefore two lines, each with its own quantity and
 * its own number selector. These helpers are the only place lines are merged,
 * grown or replaced, so the POS screen can't grow a customised line by mistake
 * (the bug where tapping + on a tile silently added another unit *with* an
 * add-on the new unit was not supposed to carry).
 *
 * Tile `+` never copies add-ons. It adds (or grows) a *plain* unit — no
 * add-ons, no note — and leaves any customised sibling alone. Growing a
 * customised configuration is the cart-line stepper's job, where the number
 * sits on that line. The previous "smart +" still copied toppings whenever the
 * cart held only one line of the product; `decideTilePlus` is what closed that
 * hole.
 *
 * Everything here is a plain function over the cart array and is unit-tested;
 * the component only wires these into state.
