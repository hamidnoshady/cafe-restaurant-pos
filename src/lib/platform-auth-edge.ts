/**
 * Phase 15 — platform-admin session primitives, safe for the Edge runtime.
 *
 * The super-admin console is a *separate auth realm*: its own cookie, its own
 * signed token, and no path from a tenant session into it or back. This file
 * mirrors `auth-edge.ts` (the tenant equivalent) and, for the same reason,
 * depends only on `jose` so `src/middleware.ts` can verify a platform session
 * on Edge without dragging in the pg pool or the tenant context.
 *
 * The token is deliberately a *different cookie* under a *different name* and
 * carries a *different claim shape* (`padmin` instead of `sub`), so a platform
 * token presented to a tenant route fails `verifySession` (wrong shape) and a
 * tenant token presented to a platform route fails `verifyPlatformSession`.
 * That mutual unusability is one of the phase's exit criteria.
