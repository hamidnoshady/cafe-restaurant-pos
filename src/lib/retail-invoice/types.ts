/**
 * Strong types for the retail invoice domain — the retail counterpart of the
 * generic order/order-item shapes the café POS uses.
 *
 * `RetailInvoiceLineSnapshot` is a discriminated union on `kind`, matching
 * `RetailInvoiceLineInput` in retail-invoice-service.ts one-for-one: a line is
 * priced one way and printed one way per industry, and a union makes it
 * impossible to, say, read `.serialNumber` off a gold line at compile time.
 *
 * These types are framework/DB-free (no `pg`, no Next) so they can be shared
 * by the write path (retail-invoice-service.ts), the read model
 * (read-service.ts), the print pipeline (print-data.ts) and the client
 * screens without a dependency cycle.
