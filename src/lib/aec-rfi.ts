/**
 * Issue #799 §10 and §11 — the RFI and submittal domain's pure half: the two
 * status models with their transition rules, the submittal types, and the three
 * small predicates the screens, the assistant and the overdue scan all need
 * (is this RFI overdue, is this submittal waiting on somebody, is this revision
 * still editable).
 *
 * Pure, like `aec.ts`, `aec-boq.ts` and `aec-docs.ts`: the client panels need
 * the same labels and the same rules the service applies, and they must not drag
 * `pg` in with them. Nothing here decides a permission — that is the route's job
 * (§24) — and nothing here talks to a database.
 *
 * ## Two decisions worth reading twice
 *
 *   * **A submittal is a register entry with revisions, exactly like a
 *     drawing.** §11 lists "revision" among the fields to track and its workflow
 *     contains «Revise & Resubmit», which is the loop a site actually spends its
 *     week in. Storing the loop as "overwrite the row" would erase what a
 *     reviewer approved; storing it as a revision chain — `aec_submittals`
 *     → `aec_submittal_revisions`, the same shape as `aec_documents`
 *     → `aec_document_revisions` — keeps every submitted revision frozen with
 *     the decision it received, and makes "Revise & Resubmit" a new row rather
 *     than an edit of history.
 *   * **"Waiting" is derived from a status, never typed.** Three different
 *     screens ask "what is stuck?" (the cockpit KPI, the assistant's
 *     `list_pending_submittals`, the overdue notification scan), and they must
 *     give one answer. `isRfiWaiting` / `isSubmittalWaiting` are that answer.
