/**
 * The role taxonomy: which roles exist, how each one signs in, and which ones
 * an administrator may hand out.
 *
 * This is split out of `team.ts` for the same reason `role-labels.ts` was split
 * out of the screens that used to carry their own `ROLE_LABELS` map. `team.ts`
 * imports `node:crypto` for invitation tokens, so no `"use client"` component
 * can import it — and three of them had responded by hand-copying the list:
 *
 *   src/app/dashboard/dashboard-sidebar.tsx   const PIN_ROLES = [...]
 *   src/app/dashboard/team/team-manager.tsx   const PIN_ROLES = [...]
 *   src/lib/platform-user-menu.ts             const PIN_ROLES = [...]
 *
 * each with a comment pointing back at `team.ts`, which is a comment doing a
 * compiler's job. Two new roles (`admin`, `viewer`) landed with the
 * authorization refactor and none of the three copies learned about them.
 * Which roles exist is a fact about the product, not a screen-local decision,
 * so it lives in one framework-free, client-safe module and every caller —
 * server route, server component, client component — asks this file.
 *
 * `team.ts` re-exports the sign-in predicates so its existing server callers
 * are unaffected, the same arrangement it already makes for `pin-policy.ts`.
