/**
 * The permission matrix — what each built-in role may do, asserted exhaustively.
 *
 * ## Why this file is a snapshot of the whole grid rather than spot checks
 *
 * The role presets are edited whenever a feature ships: a new permission key
 * gets added to `manager` so managers keep the screen they already had, an app
 * is split into graded capabilities, a preset is "tidied". Every one of those
 * edits is a one-line diff, and a one-line diff to a preset is indistinguishable
 * — in review — from a one-line privilege escalation.
 *
 * Spot checks ("a cashier cannot refund") do not catch that, because the
 * escalation is always in the key nobody thought to spot-check. So this asserts
 * the *entire* effective set for every role. Adding a permission to a preset is
 * then a visible, deliberate change to this file, and a reviewer sees exactly
 * which role gained what.
