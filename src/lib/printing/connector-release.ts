/**
 * The Windows Print Connector release the web app knows about, and the rules
 * for *where the connector payload is downloaded from*.
 *
 * Two different facts were previously forced into one value — the tenant
 * origin a browser was using — and that coupling is what made first install
 * fragile:
 *
 *   A. `$allowedOrigin` — the Cafe POS browser origin the loopback connector
 *      serves printer access to. This is tenant-specific by design (strict
 *      CORS), and it is decided by the installer route from the request host,
 *      using the same host policy the tenant boundary itself uses.
 *
 *   B. `$connectorDownloadUrl` — where the bootstrap downloads the connector
 *      payload from. This must be a *stable, platform-controlled* address:
 *      one DNS name the deployment operator provisions once, rather than
 *      every tenant's `{subdomain}.{root}` hostname, whose resolution on the
 *      cashier's machine depends on the local DNS resolver's mood (the
 *      zaniziba.app.eshobe.com first-install failure). The payload itself is
 *      tenant-neutral, so tenant DNS was never the right place to fetch it.
 *
 * Version numbers are centralised here rather than repeated as magic numbers:
 * `CONNECTOR_PROTOCOL_VERSION` is the wire contract (browser client ↔
 * connector ↔ installer health gate), and `CONNECTOR_RELEASE` is the
 * human/support-facing release string the connector reports on /health and
 * the installer writes to install.log. The contract test pins the PowerShell
 * connector file to both.

 *     — there the request origin is the right base.
 *  3. The request origin itself. A machine that just downloaded the installer
 *     from that origin can reach it again; for single-origin installs it is
 *     the only name guaranteed to serve this exact build of the app.
 *
 * Returns null when nothing usable exists (the caller fails the request with
