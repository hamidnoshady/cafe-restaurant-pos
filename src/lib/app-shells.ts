/**
 * The dashboard apps that own their own main sidebar.
 *
 * Phase 35 grouped the flat nav entries into apps (`apps.ts`) and Phase 35
 * Wave 2 made the workspace rail a *launcher* for them; Phase 36b gave Growth &
 * Marketing its own routes and its own menu. What none of that did was say who
 * renders the sidebar *inside* an app: the shell kept drawing the business's
 * flat nav, so opening `/dashboard/growth` showed the accounting pages in the
 * app slot and tucked the app's real menu inside the page — a sub-menu of a
 * page inside the accounting sidebar, which is exactly what made the app look
 * like a folder of accounting rather than a product.
 *
 * A *shell* is the answer to that question: an app whose routes replace the
 * business nav with the app's own main menu, and which is launched from the
 * rail as a peer of حسابداری. `apps.ts` still answers "which app owns this
 * module" and `industry-profile.ts` "does this trade have it"; this answers
 * only "whose menu is this route". Three separate questions, each with one
 * place to look — the same split `bottom-nav.ts` and `sidebar-state.ts` keep.
 *
 * Framework-free like those, so the rule is unit-testable and the sidebar can
 * import it without pulling in a client component. What an app's menu *contains*
 * stays with the app (`growth/growth-nav.ts`); this registry only says which
 * routes belong to an app's own menu, and what the app is called there.
 *
 * Adding a shell means three things, and only three:
 * 1. an entry here, naming the route prefix the app owns;
 * 2. the app's nav component, registered in `app-shell-nav.ts`;
 * 3. its entry in the workspace rail, so the app is launched beside حسابداری
 *    rather than from inside it.
