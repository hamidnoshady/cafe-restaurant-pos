 * The predicate that decides **which shift or business day an order belongs

 * (shift-orders-service.ts) so the orders screen and the shift report can never
 * disagree about whose order it is — the two used to answer that question with
 * different columns, and a bill carried across a cash-up was the case where
 * they contradicted each other.
 *
 * Bucketing on `opened_at` rather than `closed_at` is the load-bearing part. A
 * table opened at 23:30 and finally settled at 08:00 the next morning is one
 * sale, and it is the *night* shift's sale: that is the shift that seated the
 * guests, rang the items in, and is answerable for the bill. Keying on
 * `closed_at` instead credited it to whichever shift happened to take the last
 * payment, so a carried-over bill left the shift that opened it and inflated a
 * shift that had nothing to do with it.
 *
 * Both bounds are inclusive, and a null upper bound leaves the window open-ended
 * rather than clamping it to this instant: a running shift and the branch's live
 * window have no end yet, and clamping would quietly drop a row whose
 * `opened_at` is ahead of the server clock — a till with a skewed clock, or a
 * sale typed in for a moment that has not arrived — from the one screen a
 * cashier would use to notice. Written against `$2` (window start) and `$3`
 * (window end) so every caller binds the same parameter positions.

 *   - a bill opened *before* the window is never listed, even though the
 *     payment landed inside it. It stays with the shift that opened it, and is
 *     reached by picking that shift rather than by appearing twice.
 *
 * Voided orders are kept rather than filtered out: "what happened to order #12"
 * is exactly the question this list exists to answer, and the caller renders
