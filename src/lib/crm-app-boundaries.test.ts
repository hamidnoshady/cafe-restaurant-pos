/**
 * The CRM's boundaries, enforced by reading its own source.
 *
 * ## Why a source-level test
 *
 * `APP_DATA_RULES` states who owns what. A document stating a rule does not
 * keep it: the WooCommerce sync wrote `parties` directly for two years while
 * the rules file said the Website app was a reader, and nothing noticed
 * because nothing checked.
 *
 * These are the checks. They are cheap, they run in the normal unit suite, and
 * they fail on the pull request that breaks the boundary rather than in
 * production six months later when two screens start disagreeing about what a
 * customer owes.
 *
 * Each rule below names the specific damage it prevents. A rule nobody can
 * justify is a rule that gets deleted the first time it is inconvenient, so
 * none of them is here on general principle.
