/**
 * Every reference to a party's identity, and what a merge must do with it.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * A merge used to be a hand-written list of `UPDATE` statements inside
 * `mergeCustomers()`. Every time the platform grew a new customer-linked table
 * — a WooCommerce customer mapping, a gold account, a layaway plan, a message
 * recipient — that list silently fell one table behind, and nothing failed.
 * The symptom was ugly and quiet: a Woo store kept its mapping pointed at the
 * *archived* record, so the next webhook resolved an online order onto a
 * customer who no longer exists, and the sale disappeared from the surviving
 * file.
 *
 * A hardcoded list cannot be audited. A **declared** one can: this registry is
 * compared against PostgreSQL's own foreign-key metadata by
 * `integration/party-merge-coverage.integration.test.ts`, so a new table with a
 * column pointing at `parties` fails the suite until somebody states what a
 * merge should do with it. Adding the table is how you find out you owe the
 * decision.
 *
 * ## The three dispositions
 *
 * - **`move`** — operational data that belongs to the person. After a merge it
 *   must resolve to the winner, because a live system reading it would
 *   otherwise reach an archived record. Orders, receipts, loyalty, deals,
 *   cases, external store mappings.
 * - **`historical`** — a row whose *whole meaning* is "this is what the losing
 *   record was". Moving it would destroy the audit trail the merge exists to
 *   leave behind. `crm_merges.loser_id` is the canonical example: repointing it
 *   at the winner would turn "A was merged into B" into "B was merged into B".
 * - **`blocked`** — a reference nobody has classified. Merge refuses rather
 *   than guessing. This is the fail-closed default and the reason the registry
 *   is worth having: an unknown reference stops a destructive, irreversible
 *   operation instead of being quietly left behind.
 *
 * ## Tenancy
 *
 * Some tables carry `business_id`; some are branch-scoped and reach the tenant
 * through `locations`. Both shapes are declared here (`scope`) so the generated
 * UPDATE can never move a row across tenants even if an id leaked into a
 * request. There is no third shape — a new table that has neither is `blocked`
 * by construction, which is the correct answer.
 *
 * Framework-free and side-effect-free: no `pg` import, no SQL execution. It is
 * a policy document the service reads, which is what makes it unit-testable.
