 * was wrong in practice in three separate ways, each of which showed an empty
 * list on a branch that had been trading all day: a business whose staff never
 * clock in has no shift at all; an owner/manager *cannot* clock in (the shift
 * routes are cashier/waiter/kitchen only); and a cashier who clocks in at 14:00
 * would hide everything sold that morning. Anchoring on the business day fixes
 * all three, and taking the earlier of the two keeps a night shift that crossed
 * local midnight whole instead of truncating it at 00:00.
 *
 * Shifts are per employee (one open shift each), so a branch with two people
 * clocked in has two rows and the earliest wins — a colleague arriving mid-
 * service never narrows the window. A shift row whose location is null counts
 * for the branch: rows written before shifts recorded a fallback branch (see
 * openShift) have no branch of their own, and dropping them would reintroduce
 * exactly the empty list this function exists to prevent. Reads stay tenant-
 * scoped by RLS, and the orders themselves are always filtered by branch, so
 * the only thing such a row can affect is where the window starts.
 *
 * All of that is the *calendar-day* branch of this function, and it is left
 * exactly as it was. A branch that has configured a business day (روز کاری,
 * migration 0076) takes the other branch, where the trading day is authoritative
 * and the employee-shift widening is deliberately not applied: the business day
 * already keeps a night service that crosses midnight whole — which is the only
 * thing that widening was ever compensating for — and honouring an employee who
 * clocked in before the day started, or forgot to clock out last night, would
 * pull the *previous* business day's sales back into this one's list. A manual

 * Shift history for the admin review tab, most recent first — each row's
 * cash summary/variance is computed in the same query via a LATERAL join
 * (Wave 7 — resolves this doc's Wave 5/6 open question 1), instead of the
 * settings tab making one `shiftCashSummary` round trip per shift.
 *
 * Paged rather than the flat `LIMIT 200` it shipped with. Two hundred rows is
 * roughly a fortnight for a branch with four staff, so the tab both stopped
 * showing older shifts — silently, with nothing on screen saying so — and sent
 * two hundred rows plus two hundred correlated aggregates down the wire to a
 * phone on every visit. The page carries `hasMore` so the UI can say which of
 * those two things is happening.
 *
 * A branch filter matches rows with no branch of their own as well, the same
 * rule `branchClosedOrdersWindow` and `getBusinessDayStatus` already apply: a
 * shift only records a branch when the session that opened it had one, and
 * dropping those rows would hide the very shifts a single-branch business
 * records. Both ids are uuid-guarded — `WHERE id = $1` against a `uuid` column
 * raises `invalid input syntax` for a non-uuid, which surfaces as a 500 rather
 * than an empty list (see uuid.ts).
