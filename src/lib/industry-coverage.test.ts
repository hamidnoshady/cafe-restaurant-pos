/**
 * Issue #799 — the CI guard for "a future industry cannot silently be missed".
 *
 * Adding a business type to `industries.ts` used to be a compile error in some
 * places and a silent omission in others. `Record<Industry, …>` is checked by
 * `tsc`, so a missing key there fails the type check (that is how this issue's
 * own implementation found all nine of them). What the compiler cannot see is
 * everything *outside* TypeScript's exhaustiveness rules:
 *
 *   * the SQL `businesses_industry_check` constraint — a migration list that
 *     must name every industry or provisioning fails at runtime with a
 *     constraint violation, long after typecheck passed;
 *   * `Partial<Record<Industry, …>>` and hand-written arrays — a UI list, a
 *     report's `requires.industries` — where a missing entry is legitimate for
 *     some trades and a bug for others, so the compiler stays silent;
 *   * the cross-cutting registries (chart of accounts, wizard steps, module
 *     sets) which each have a "must answer for every trade" contract;
 *   * test fixtures restating the list by hand, which is exactly how the
 *     industry-picker tests broke when this industry was added.
 *
 * This file asserts those contracts directly. Three kinds of check live here:
 *
 *   1. per-industry contracts — every industry answers, and its answers are
 *      structurally sound (unique label, valid chart, a wizard that starts at
 *      the beginning);
 *   2. the database constraint — the newest `businesses_industry_check` in
 *      `migrations/` names every industry exactly once;
 *   3. a source scan — a hard-coded list of three or more industry keys in
 *      non-test source must be one of the exported registry sets. Restating a
 *      list is then a *decision* (add an export, or extend the allowlist with
 *      a note) rather than an accident.
 *
 * Deliberately not a snapshot of file contents: it asserts properties, so
 * refactors stay free and only genuine omissions fail.
