/**
 * Phase G, Part 2 — persist AI chat media into the Media Library.
 *
 * Until now a file a user pasted into the assistant (a receipt photo, an
 * invoice image) lived only for the length of one turn: ai-attachment.ts states
 * plainly that "nothing here touches a table or object storage". That was the
 * right call while the library had no vocabulary for AI-originated files; Part 1
 * added it (media_assets.source / created_by_ai / conversation_id / project_id).
 * This module is the write path that uses it.
 *
 * The split mirrors the rest of the AI subsystem: the PURE half here
 * (`decodeImageDataUrl`) validates and decodes a base64 image data URL with no
 * I/O and is unit-tested; the DB/S3 half (`persistChatImageAttachments`) is a
 * thin, BEST-EFFORT orchestration that the chat route calls after the turn is
 * already answered. Persisting a file must never fail or slow a turn, so every
 * failure here is swallowed and logged — the library gains a file or it does
 * not, but the conversation is unaffected.
