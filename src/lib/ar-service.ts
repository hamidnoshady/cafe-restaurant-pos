/**
 * Phase 16 — AR subledger, the DB-touching part.
 *
 * A customer's balance, statement, and aging are all reconstructed from the
 * same source: every journal line ever posted to the Accounts Receivable
 * account, attributed to a customer via the order (source_type='order'),
 * receipt (source_type='ar_receipt'), or received cheque (source_type='cheque')
 * that caused it. This is the same "compute from the ledger, never a shadow copy" discipline the financial
 * statements use (reports-service.ts), so a customer's balance always agrees
 * with the control account to the Rial by construction rather than by care.
 *
 * DB-touching, so per repo convention it has no direct unit test; the pure
 * aging math (shared with the AP subledger) lives in aging.ts and is what
 * aging.test.ts covers. Covered here by integration/ar.integration.test.ts.
