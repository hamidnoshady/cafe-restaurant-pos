/**
 * Kitchen ticket status machine — pure functions.
 *
 * order_items.status flow (see migrations/0001_foundation.sql order_item_status enum):
 *   pending → sent → preparing → ready → served
 * with `voided` reachable from any non-served state. "Sent" is the moment an
 * item becomes a kitchen ticket line (sent_to_kitchen_at is set); the KDS only
 * ever shows sent/preparing/ready items. Bumping is kitchen-driven
 * (sent→preparing, preparing→ready); marking served is waiter/cashier-driven
 * (ready→served), once the food has actually left the pass.
