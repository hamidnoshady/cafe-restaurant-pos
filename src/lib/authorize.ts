/**
 * The canonical authorization layer.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The platform had grown four different answers to "may this request proceed",
 * and they did not agree with each other:
 *
 *   * `requireRole(...roles)` (auth.ts, ~500 call sites) — compared
 *     `session.role`, the role baked into the JWT at login, against a literal
 *     list. It checked `platform_users.token_version`, and nothing else.
 *   * `requirePermission(key)` (auth.ts, ~105 call sites) — re-read the
 *     membership from the database and checked `is_active`, the business's
 *     status and the *current* role, but did NOT check `token_version`.
 *   * `requireManager()` (setup-state.ts, ~57 call sites) — compared
 *     `session.role` against `"owner" | "manager"` and checked nothing at all.
 *   * `requireMember()` (auth.ts, ~22 call sites) — proved only that a token
 *     verified.
 *
 * The consequences were concrete, not theoretical:
 *
 *   1. A member who was **deactivated** kept full access to every
 *      `requireRole`- and `requireManager`-guarded endpoint — roughly 560 of
 *      them, including backup restore and the entire website admin — until
 *      their JWT expired, because neither guard ever looked at `is_active`.
 *   2. A member whose **role was changed** (manager → cashier) kept their old
 *      role's access on those same endpoints, because the guard read the role
 *      from the token rather than from the database.
 *   3. A **suspended business** kept serving those endpoints for the lifetime
 *      of already-issued tokens.
 *   4. `requirePermission`, the *newer* and supposedly stricter guard, was the
 *      only one that skipped the `token_version` check — so the password-reset
 *      kill switch worked on legacy endpoints and not on modern ones.
 *
 * Every one of those is a different guard forgetting a different check. The
 * fix is not to remember harder in 560 places; it is to have one place. This
 * file is that place, and the four helpers above are now thin wrappers over
 * it, so a security property added here is added everywhere at once.
 *
 * ## The evaluation order
 *
 * Authenticated identity → current tenant membership → membership active? →
 * tenant active? → role preset → member grants/revokes → effective permissions
 * → owner rules → branch scope → decision.
 *
 * Deny by default: every path that is not an explicit allow returns a denial
 * with a machine-readable reason.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not cache across requests. The whole point of re-reading the
 * membership is that a suspension, a role change or a revoked permission takes
 * effect on the member's *next request*; a cross-request cache would reinstate
 * exactly the staleness this file exists to remove. It memoises within a
 * single request only (see `requestMemo`), which is safe because a request
 * cannot outlive itself.
