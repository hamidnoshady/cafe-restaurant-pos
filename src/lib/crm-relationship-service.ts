/**
 * Relationships between parties — «ارتباط اشخاص».
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * A business rarely sells to an abstraction. It sells to «شرکت الف» but talks
 * to «خانم رضایی», invoices «آقای تهرانی» in accounts payable, and needs a
 * different person's signature to close anything. Without a relationship
 * model, those four facts live in a notes field and nobody can answer "who do
 * I call about this invoice?" without reading it.
 *
 * The model is deliberately **a graph over `parties`, not a second hierarchy**.
 * Every node is already a party with its own file, history and consent; a
 * contact of a company is a real person who might also be a retail customer in
 * their own right. Modelling contacts as rows belonging to an organisation
 * would fork that identity in two.
 *
 * ## Direction matters, and is not symmetric
 *
 * `from → to` reads as "from is *kind* of to": «خانم رضایی» is
 * `contact_of` «شرکت الف». The reverse edge is a different statement and is
 * not created automatically, because the inverse of "is a contact of" is "has
 * as a contact", which is not the same relation and would double every count.
 *
 * `household` and `referred_by` are the exceptions people expect to be
 * symmetric — and `household` genuinely is, so the service creates both
 * directions for it. `referred_by` is emphatically not: A referred B does not
 * mean B referred A, and conflating them would corrupt attribution.
 *
 * ## Merging is not handled here
 *
 * When two parties merge, their edges have to be re-pointed — and both the
 * self-edges (the loser was a contact of the winner) and the collisions (both
 * were contacts of the same company) have to be dropped first, or the merge
 * aborts on a constraint. That logic lives in `party-merge-references.ts`,
 * which declares both directions of this table with `selfEdgeColumn` and
 * `uniqueWithSql`, and the merge service applies it generically. Writing a
 * second copy here is precisely the hand-maintained list that registry
 * replaced.
