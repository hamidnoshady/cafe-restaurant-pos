/**
 * "Which door did this browser last use to sign in?" — the missing piece the
 * audit found: a tenant's origin used to jump straight into the staff
 * quick-login roster with no way to discover the owner/manager door (`/admin`)
 * existed at all, unless a member happened to be in the phone-OTP grace
 * window's number-entry step, where a single sentence named it in passing.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT an authorization boundary — `/admin` and `/login`
 * already enforce who may sign in where server-side (see
 * `admin-login-form.tsx`, `login-form.tsx`, `/api/auth/login`,
 * `/api/auth/pin-login`). It is only a *device-local UI shortcut*: which door
 * this browser is shown first, so a shared till skips the chooser after the
 * first visit while an owner's laptop can still switch doors at any time.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from `device-token.ts`: that module is a *server*
 * credential (a paired-device row, biometric registration). This is pure
 * client-side memory with no security meaning — clearing it, or a private
 * window never writing it, only ever re-shows the chooser.
