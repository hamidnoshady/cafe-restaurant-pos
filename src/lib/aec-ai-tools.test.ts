/**
 * Issue #799 §23 — the AEC read tools' catalogue contract and their refusals.
 *
 * What needs no database is asserted here: the names are the ones §23 chose,
 * every one has a Persian label, the permission map covers each of them, the
 * model-facing catalogue actually defines them, and a business of another
 * industry is refused with a sentence rather than answered with an empty list.
 * The data the tools read is covered in `integration/aec.integration.test.ts`
 * and `integration/aec-document-control.integration.test.ts`.
