/**
 * The app's half of the WordPress plugin link: authenticating the plugin,
 * accepting the events it pushes, and handing it the work it should apply.
 *
 * DB-touching, so no direct unit test per repo convention — the envelope
 * verification it rests on is pure and covered by `plugin-link.test.ts`, and
 * everything an event does downstream is the *same* code the REST/webhook path
 * already runs (`webhook-ingest-service.ts`). That reuse is the point: a store
 * connected by plugin and a store connected by consumer keys produce
 * byte-identical orders, payments and journal entries, because there is one
 * ingest path and this is only a second door into it.
 *
 * ## Direction of travel
 *
 * REST mode: the app calls the store (outbound), the store calls the app
 * (webhooks, inbound). Both directions need the store to be reachable from the
 * internet and the app to hold the store's master credentials.
 *
 * Plugin mode: the plugin calls the app, always — pushing events it saw, and
 * pulling jobs to apply. The app never dials out. A store behind a firewall,
 * on a host that blocks incoming webhooks, or with no fixed address works
 * unchanged, and the only credential in this database is a token that grants
 * exactly this.
