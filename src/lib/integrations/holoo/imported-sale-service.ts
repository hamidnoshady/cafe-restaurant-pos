/**
 * Order-ticket sales imported from Holoo.
 *
 * A migration brings across trading that already happened: last month's
 * invoices, the year before the install. For a `retail_invoice` tenant those
 * land through `createRetailInvoice`; for an `order_ticket` one (a café, a
 * restaurant) the local shape is an `orders` row, and this is the writer for
 * it.
 *
 * Every timestamp it writes is the instant the sale *happened* rather than
 * `now()`, which is the whole point of importing history:
 *
 *   * `orders.opened_at` / `closed_at`, which is what every day-bucketed
 *     report reads through `app_business_date` (migration 0076), so an
 *     imported sale lands on the trading day it belongs to — including for a
 *     branch whose day starts at 18:00;
 *   * `stock_movements.occurred_at`, via `deductForOrder`'s `occurredAt`, so
 *     the stock ledger agrees with the sales one; and
 *   * `journal_entries.entry_date`, via `postExact*`'s `entryDate`, which is
 *     also what puts the posting under migration 0024's fiscal-period lock for
 *     the month the sale belongs to rather than the current one. A closed month
 *     refuses the import instead of quietly absorbing it.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately *not* moved back:
 *
 *   * the order number, which comes off the branch's ordinary counter. Numbers
 *     are the sequence bills were issued in, not a second date.
 *   * the table. An imported dine-in sale carries its channel as a label but
 *     never a `table_id`: seating is live floor state, and occupying table 4
 *     tonight because of an invoice from last spring would be a lie the floor
 *     screen has no way to correct.
 *
 * No posting rule is re-implemented here: totals, tender validation, stock
 * consumption and both journal entries all go through the same services the
 * live checkout uses.
