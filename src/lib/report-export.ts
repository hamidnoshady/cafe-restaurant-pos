/**
 * Report export — the tabular shape the report routes speak, rendered through
 * the platform's one codec layer.
 *
 * `ReportTable` ({columns, rows}) is deliberately still here: it is the shape
 * the export route builds from a raw view dump or an aggregated dim/value
 * query, and it is what decides which columns to show.
 *
 * What is no longer here is a second CSV writer and a second XLSX writer.
 * Both now delegate to `data-transfer/codecs.ts`, which is the single
 * implementation for the whole product. That is not only tidiness: the copy
 * this file used to carry had **no formula-injection guard**, so a report cell
 * beginning `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` was executed by Excel when the downloaded
 * file was opened. The shared writer neutralises it, and the reports export
 * inherited that fix by losing its private copy.
