/**
 * Saved views — «نماهای ذخیره‌شده».
 *
 * A saved view is a named set of filters on a list: «مشتریان بدهکار تهران»,
 * «سرنخ‌های داغ این هفته». It exists because the alternative is people
 * rebuilding the same five filters every morning, and then not bothering, and
 * then not using the filters at all.
 *
 * ## Filters are a validated document, never SQL
 *
 * The stored `filters` column is JSON, and this service validates it against a
 * **closed vocabulary per entity** before it is saved and again before it is
 * used. Nothing here interpolates a stored string into a query.
 *
 * That matters more than it looks. A saved view is user-authored content that
 * one member creates and another member's browser executes — which is the
 * shape of a stored injection. Keeping the vocabulary closed means the worst a
 * malicious view can do is filter on a field that does not exist, and the
 * worst *that* does is return nothing.
 *
 * ## Private by default is wrong; shared by default is also wrong
 *
 * `owner_user_id` NULL means the view is the business's; set means it is one
 * member's. The caller chooses explicitly. Defaulting either way silently
 * surprises somebody: a private view that turns out to be shared exposes how
 * one salesperson works, and a shared view that turns out to be private means
 * the manager who built it for the team is the only one who sees it.
