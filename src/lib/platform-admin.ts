/**
 * Phase 15 — what each platform-admin role may do.
 *
 * Answering open question 3 (differentiated platform roles): one level is not
 * enough. The console has surfaces of very different danger, and reserving the
 * dangerous ones for the most trusted operators is cheaper than trusting every
 * admin equally.
 *
 *   - support  — the day-to-day desk. Reads everything, and may enter a
 *     business *read-only* to see what a customer sees. Changes nothing.
 *   - engineer — support, plus the write side of operations: feature flags,
 *     suspend/reactivate, system/job controls. Cannot provision, cannot
 *     hard-delete, cannot take full-access control of a business.
 *   - owner    — the whole console: provisioning, archive/hard-delete, granting
 *     full-access impersonation, and managing other platform admins.
 *
 * This module is pure — the single place the role→capability mapping lives, so
 * it can be unit-tested directly and both the API guard and the console UI ask
 * the same question and get the same answer.

  // pull artifacts from this one. An engineer may operate it because backing up
  // is ordinary operations, like flags and suspension: it reads everything and
  // overwrites nothing. …
  | "backup.manage"
  // Migration 0139 — administering the website platform (eshobe-cms) from this
  // console: its address and platform key, a site's lifecycle, issuing and revoking
  // site keys, and syncing content in either direction. An engineer holds it for the
  // same reason they hold `backup.manage`: keeping the fleet's websites serving is
  // ordinary operations, and the alternative is an operator opening the CMS's own
  // admin on another host, where nothing this console does is audited. Reading the
  // CMS report rides `system.read` — knowing that four domains are unverified is not
  // privileged information.
  | "cms.manage"
  | "business.suspend"
  // Platform billing: credit packages, plan builder, wallet
  // grants and payment approval.
  | "billing.manage"
  // Billing (migration 0176) — the fine-grained split of `billing.manage`
  // demanded by the Billing Control Center. Granted today to exactly the
  // roles that hold `billing.manage` (engineer + owner), so splitting the
  // vocabulary changes no one's access — it only lets a future grant hand a
  // desk one slice of the console (e.g. payments review without price
  // policy). `billing.view` is the read half: every admin role holds it,
  // matching the reads that previously required only a login.
  | "billing.view"
  | "plans.manage"
  | "payments.review"
  | "gateways.manage"
  | "adjustments.manage"
  // Messaging (migration 0137+): SMS/Email provider credentials, rates, credit
  // packages and top-up approval. Its own capability rather than riding
  // `billing.manage` so the messaging desk is not coupled to the payments
  // console; granted to the same roles, so no operator loses access.
  | "messaging.manage"
  // Media (migration 0149): the tenant object-storage connection, storage
  // pricing and AI image-enhancement pricing. Its own capability rather than
  // riding `backup.manage` (which is about the deployment's database backup, a
  // different domain); granted to the same roles.
  | "media.manage"
  // Security (migration 0140s): MFA policy/enforcement, grace extensions and the
  // Kavenegar OTP provider. Its own capability rather than riding
  // `system.read`; the write side needs a real boundary.
  | "security.manage"
  // Owner-only business data operations
  | "business.edit"
  | "business.reset"
  // Learning content: the per-section knowledge-base URLs every business's
  // «آموزش» modal opens.
  | "knowledge.manage"
  // The support desk (migration 0130): reading and answering every business's
  // support tickets. Given to every admin role — answering tickets is the
  // `support` role's whole job, and there is no read-only half worth
  // separating: the console's ticket page is read surfaces plus the reply box,
  // and every write is audited.

  // an operations task: it is the one console action that can destroy more data
  // than deleting every business on the platform, so it needs `backup.restore`,
  // which no role but owner holds.
  | "backup.restore"
