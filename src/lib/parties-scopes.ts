/**
 * Party scopes — how one shared record looks different in each app.
 *
 * The rule this encodes: **the data is one thing, the screens are many.** Every
 * app that lists «اشخاص» mounts the same section component over the same
 * `/api/parties` endpoint and the same `parties` table; what differs is which
 * roles it shows, which columns it draws, and what it lets you edit there. A
 * café owner opening the CRM sees customers and their phones; the same person
 * opening Accounting sees the whole file including the ledger number; the store
 * clerk opening Inventory sees suppliers; the Team tab sees personnel; Growth
 * sees the same customers with lifecycle and loyalty columns.
 *
 * Why a table of scopes rather than four hand-written sections: the moment the
 * per-app views are four copies, one of them drifts — a column appears in
 * Accounting and never in the CRM, or the inventory view starts editing tax rates
 * the ledger owns. `PARTY_SCOPES` is the one place that answers "what does this
 * app show", and `parties-scopes.test.ts` is what keeps it answering for every
 * app in `apps.ts`.
 *
 * Framework-free, like `apps.ts` itself.
