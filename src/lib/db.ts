 *
 * The GUCs are set on EVERY checkout, including to empty when there is no

 * be reused while still carrying the previous caller's business, because the
 * next caller always overwrites it before issuing a statement.

/**
 * Run `fn` with tenant isolation deliberately stood down.
 *
 * Every legitimate reason shares one shape — resolving *which* tenant a
 * request is for, before that tenant can be known any other way — and
 * `reason` records which:
 *
 *   - **login** — resolving an email to the businesses it belongs to
 *     necessarily happens before a business has been chosen;
 *   - **platform** — the super-user realm administers every tenant by
 *     definition (Phase 15), as does the migration runner;
 *   - **server-sync-auth** — resolving a server-sync bearer token to the
 *     business it belongs to (Phase 17) is the same "identify the tenant
 *     first" problem as login, just keyed on a token instead of an email;
 *   - **api-key-auth** — resolving a public API bearer key to the
 *     business/location it belongs to (Phase 19) has the same identify-the-
 *     tenant-first shape as server-sync authentication;
 *   - **woocommerce-webhook-auth** — resolving an inbound WooCommerce webhook
 *     delivery (keyed on the connection id in its URL) to the business its
 *     store belongs to, before that business can be known any other way
 *     (Phase 23);
 *   - **woocommerce-plugin-auth** — the same lookup for the other way a store
 *     connects: resolving the WordPress plugin's link token to the connection,
 *     and therefore the business, that issued it. Keyed on a token hash rather
 *     than a URL id, which makes it the same shape as server-sync-auth and
 *     api-key-auth; the request's HMAC envelope is verified inside the same
 *     bypass, because the token it is verified against is what the lookup
 *     returns;
 *   - **identity** — a narrow write to the global identity table
 *     (`platform_users`, which carries no `business_id` to scope by) on
 *     behalf of a membership already verified to belong to the caller's own
 *     business, e.g. team-service.ts's credential reset;
 *   - **employee-session-auth** — re-checking an `employee_sessions` row
 *     (Phase 20 Wave 2) is still active, from `getSession()`, which runs
 *     this check before `enterTenantScope` has been called for the request —
 *     the same timing constraint `checkImpersonation`'s `activeGrant` lookup
 *     already has, just for a PIN login's session record instead of an
 *     impersonation grant.
 *   - **pairing-redeem** — resolving a one-time desktop pairing code to the
 *     business it was issued for (and reading that business's configuration to
 *     build the snapshot) happens before any tenant has been chosen, the same
 *     identify-the-tenant-first shape as server-sync-auth. Its counterpart on
 *     the local install, `applyPairingSnapshot`, runs under **platform** for
 *     the same reason `provisionBusiness` does: it creates the tenant that
 *     scoping would otherwise require to already exist.
 *
 *   - **host-resolution** — resolving a request's hostname to the business it
 *     addresses (Phase 23). The host *is* how a tenant gets identified once
 *     each business has its own origin, so this is the same identify-the-
 *     tenant-first shape as login and server-sync-auth, keyed on a DNS label.
 *     One read-only lookup against `businesses` and
 *     `business_subdomain_aliases`, returning the business's identity and
 *     nothing else about it.
 *
 *   - **impersonation-handoff** — redeeming the one-time token the console
 *     mints on admin.{root} so the browser can mint its impersonation session
 *     on the business's own origin (Phase 23 follow-up). The caller has no
 *     session on that origin yet — the token is what creates the first one —
 *     the same identify-the-tenant-first shape as login and accept-invite.
 *
 *   - **first-run** — `hasAnyUser()`: whether this install has been claimed by
 *     anyone at all. Install-wide by definition and asked before a tenant
 *     exists (it is what decides whether one should be created), so there is no
 *     scope that could express it — and left unscoped, RLS would answer 0
 *     forever, which is the failure mode this reason exists to prevent rather
 *     than a convenience. Returns a boolean about the install, never a row.
 *
 *   - **single-tenant-check** — `restoreAvailable()`: whether this install
 *     holds exactly one business. The same shape as `first-run` — a `count(*)`
 *     about the *install*, which no tenant scope can express, since the whole
 *     question is "is there more than one tenant here". It gates a
 *     whole-database restore, which replaces every business on the install, so
 *     scoped it would answer 1 on a shared server and green-light the one
 *     operation that must never run there. Returns a boolean, never a row.
 *
 * Every call is a hole in the isolation boundary, so keep them few, keep them
 * short, and never let one wrap a request body that also handles tenant data.
