/**
 * Where a customer, lead or deal came from.
 *
 * ## Why a vocabulary and not free text
 *
 * "Where did this customer come from?" is the question every marketing budget
 * turns on, and it is unanswerable the moment the column is free text: one
 * business ends up with «اینستاگرام», «اینستا», «instagram» and «IG» as four
 * different sources, and no report can add them up. So the vocabulary is
 * closed, and anything outside it goes in `sourceDetail` — which *is* free
 * text, because «کمپین نوروز ۱۴۰۴» genuinely cannot be enumerated in advance.
 *
 * ## First-touch, never overwritten
 *
 * `acquisition_source` records how a person first arrived and is written
 * exactly once. A customer who found the shop on Instagram and later bought
 * online is still an Instagram acquisition; overwriting it with `woocommerce`
 * would silently reattribute every historical acquisition to whichever channel
 * touched the customer most recently, and the Instagram spend would look
 * worthless. `last_source` tracks the most recent touch separately, so both
 * questions have their own answer instead of one column giving a wrong answer
 * to both. Both rules are enforced in SQL at the two write sites — lead
 * conversion in `crm-lead-service.ts` and the online store's party creation in
 * `crm-external-identity.ts` — which stamp `acquisition_source` only where it
 * is NULL.
