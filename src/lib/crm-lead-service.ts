/**
 * Lead management, and the conversion that turns one into a customer.
 *
 * ## Why a lead is not a party
 *
 * The tempting shortcut is to make every enquiry a `parties` row with a
 * "lead" flag. It is the wrong call, and the damage shows up about a year in:
 * the customer directory fills with four thousand people who never bought
 * anything, every count is inflated, duplicate detection drowns in noise, and
 * nobody can clean it out because some of those rows *did* eventually buy and
 * there is no way left to tell which.
 *
 * A lead lives in its own table with its own lifecycle, and is **converted**
 * into a party once it is worth being one. Until then it costs the customer
 * directory nothing.
 *
 * ## Conversion is transactional, and it deduplicates first
 *
 * Converting does up to three things — create or link a party, optionally open
 * a deal, and mark the lead converted — and a partial conversion is a mess
 * somebody has to unpick by hand: a party with no lead pointing at it, or a
 * lead marked converted with nothing to show for it. So it is one transaction,
 * with the lead row locked `FOR UPDATE` to make a double-submit impossible.
 *
 * Before creating anything it looks for an existing customer on the canonical
 * phone or email. Skipping that check is the single most common way a CRM
 * accumulates duplicates: the person enquired in March, bought in June, and
 * converting the March lead in July silently creates their second record.
 *
 * And — as everywhere else in this codebase — an **ambiguous** match is never
 * resolved by picking one. Two candidates means conversion stops and asks.
