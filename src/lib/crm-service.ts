/**
 * The CRM app's data layer: the customer file, notes, duplicate detection and
 * merge, consent with its audit trail, activities, deals and cases.
 *
 * `crm-shared.ts` holds the pure vocabulary (stages, statuses, labels, the
 * consent-merge rule); `segments.ts` and `crm-scoring.ts` hold the pure
 * engines. This file is the DB-touching half and, per repo convention, has no
 * direct unit test — its behaviour is pinned by
 * `integration/crm.integration.test.ts`.
 *
 * Three rules run through everything below, and each exists because its
 * absence would be a real bug rather than an untidiness:
 *
 * 1. **Consent changes are never silent.** Every write that touches
 *    `sms_consent`/`marketing_consent` also appends to `crm_consent_events`,
 *    in the same statement path, so "who turned this on?" always has an
 *    answer. That is the whole reason the messaging phase can be trusted.
 * 2. **A merge moves references and archives; it never deletes and never
 *    touches an accounting document.** A posted journal entry stays exactly as
 *    posted — a merge is a directory correction, not a ledger correction.
 * 3. **Nothing about a customer is inferred where it can be read.** RFM is
 *    stored only because quintiles are a whole-population computation; every
 *    other number on the file is derived at read time from the table that owns
 *    it.

 * attributed to in the CRM; it changes no journal line, so the trial balance
