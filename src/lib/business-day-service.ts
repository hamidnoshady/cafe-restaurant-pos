/**
 * The business day (روز کاری) — the DB-touching half (not unit-tested
 * directly, per repo convention; the rules it applies live in business-day.ts
 * and are covered by business-day.test.ts).
 *
 * One read answers everything the app needs about a branch's trading day: the
 * configured start, which business day is in progress, when it began and ends,
 * whether management has closed it early, and therefore where the live
 * counters start. Every caller — the dashboard KPIs, the orders screen, the
 * settings panel — goes through `getBusinessDayStatus` rather than deriving a
 * window of its own, so no two screens can disagree about what "today" means.
 *
 * The date arithmetic is SQL's (`app_business_date` and friends, migration
 * 0076): the branch's timezone is a column, and doing it here would mean
 * re-implementing zone conversion in JavaScript for the sake of a value the
 * reporting views compute the other way anyway.
