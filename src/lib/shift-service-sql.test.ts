/**
 * The shape of the shift cash summary's SQL — the one thing about
 * `shift-service.ts` that can be checked without a database.
 *
 * `shift-service.ts` is DB-touching and therefore not unit tested (repo
 * convention; the rules it applies live in `shift.ts`). But the bug this test
 * exists to prevent was a *shape* bug, not a rule one: summing `orders.total`
 * across `orders LEFT JOIN payments` counts an order once per tender, so every
 * split-tender bill inflated the shift's gross total and its per-shift review
 * row — while `branchShiftSales`, three hundred lines above in the same file,
 * had already written the comment explaining why that join must not be summed
 * over. A structural assertion is what keeps the third copy from drifting back.
