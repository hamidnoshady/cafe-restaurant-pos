 * a set of tenders actually pays a bill.
 *
 * The distinction the whole feature rests on:
 *
 *   * a **payment way** (`payment_methods` row) is the business's own thing —
 *     its name, its position in the cashier's grid, whether it is still
 *     offered;
 *   * a **settlement** is the ledger's thing — which account the money lands
 *     in. A business can name a way anything, but it must say which of the
 *     five settlements it behaves like, because that is what
 *     `postExactOrderPaymentEntry` posts against.
 *
 * Everything here is integer Rial (src/lib/money.ts) and free of the database.

 *
