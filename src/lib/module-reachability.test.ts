/**
 * Every module under `src/` must be reachable from a real entry point.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The 2026-09 dead-code audit found a handful of modules that nothing could
 * ever load: a floating chat window and its three subcomponents, orphaned when
 * the assistant became the dashboard itself, plus the wizard wrapper that was
 * their only mount point. None of it was a type error, none of it failed a
 * test, and none of it showed up in a diff — an orphaned island compiles
 * perfectly, and the only thing wrong with it is that it is not there. So this
 * test walks the import graph the way the bundler does and fails when a module
 * has drifted off it.
 *
 * ## What counts as an entry point
 *
 * The things a runtime actually starts from, not "anything that looks used":
 *
 *  - Next.js App Router special files (`page`, `layout`, `route`, `loading`,
 *    `error`, `not-found`, `template`, `default`, metadata routes) anywhere in
 *    `src/app`. These are entry points by filename — the framework loads them,
 *    nothing imports them.
 *  - `src/middleware.ts`, the Edge entry.
 *  - Every `*.test.ts(x)`. A test is a real consumer: it is how the contract
 *    modules (`crm-deal-handoff.ts` and friends) are exercised.
 *  - `server.ts` and the repo's config files, which pull in the custom server,
 *    WebSocket handlers and background wiring.
 *  - `scripts/` and `integration/`, invoked from npm scripts, CI and the
 *    desktop/release packaging.
 *
 * ## Why an allowlist rather than a bare assertion
 *
 * A zero-reference result is a *candidate*, not proof — and this repository has
 * two legitimate shapes that a static walk cannot see. Ambient declarations
 * (`.d.ts`) are loaded by the compiler via `tsconfig`, never imported; and a
 * module may be consumed only through a string (a registry key, a dynamic
 * `import()` built at runtime). Both are listed below **with the evidence that
 * keeps them**, so adding a name here is a deliberate, reviewable act rather
 * than a way to silence the test.
 *
 * If this test fails for a file you just added, the question to answer is
 * "what loads this?" — and if the honest answer is "nothing yet", the file is
 * not ready to be committed.
