/**
 * Visual regression for the approved design system.
 *
 * Renders a short, deliberately-chosen list of screens — at least one per app,
 * including both Website Management managers — in a pinned Chromium and
 * compares each against a committed PNG baseline.
 *
 * Determinism is the whole game here; a flaky snapshot gets ignored, and an
 * ignored check is not a check. So:
 *
 *  - one viewport (1440×900, DPR 1) and one timezone (Asia/Tehran), set on the
 *    browser context rather than inherited from the machine;
 *  - `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, which the app already honours globally —
 *    this parks every transition, skeleton shimmer and staggered entry at its
 *    final frame instead of photographing them mid-animation;
 *  - the seeded demo business, never production data;
 *  - each shot waits for the page's loading skeletons to disappear, so a
 *    snapshot is of the loaded state rather than a race with it.
 *
 * Baselines live next to this harness's output in docs/design/visual/. They are
 * reviewed as images in the PR. **Never re-record a baseline to clear a failing
 * run** — read docs/design/visual-regression.md first; a diff is either a bug
 * you introduced or a design change you can describe in the PR body.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/visual-regression.mjs            # compare against baselines
 *   node scripts/visual-regression.mjs --update   # re-record (deliberate only)
