/**
 * Resolves the connection string the SERVER PROCESS should run with, as
 * distinct from `DATABASE_URL`, which the Docker entrypoint uses to run
 * migrations and must therefore stay a privileged (table-owning) connection.
 *
 * This exists because every shipped compose file (`docker-compose.local.yml`,
 * plus the retired `archive/deploy/docker-compose.komodo.yml` and
 * `archive/deploy/docker-compose.srv1.yml`) hands the app
 * container exactly one `DATABASE_URL`: the Postgres superuser also used for
 * migrations. `assertRlsEffective()` (src/lib/db.ts) correctly refuses to
 * start with that connection in production — a superuser ignores every RLS
 * policy from migration 0021 outright — which is why those deployments now
 * crash-loop until this is fixed. Rather than ask every operator to hand-edit
 * their stack's environment, the entrypoint self-heals: it runs this script
 * after migrating, and launches the server with whatever this prints instead
 * of the original `DATABASE_URL`.
 *
 * Behaviour, in order:
 *
 *   1. `RUNTIME_DATABASE_URL` set → printed verbatim. An operator who already
 *      followed the manual `npm run db:app-role` instructions and wants full
 *      control keeps it; nothing here overrides an explicit choice.
 *   2. `DATABASE_URL`'s role is already unprivileged (not superuser, not
 *      BYPASSRLS) → `DATABASE_URL` is printed unchanged. Provisioning a
 *      second role would be pointless, and attempting one would fail anyway
 *      (creating a role needs privileges this connection doesn't have).
 *   3. Otherwise → provisions (or updates) `pos_app` — reusing `DATABASE_URL`'s
 *      own password under a different username unless `APP_DB_PASSWORD` is
 *      set, since anyone who can read `DATABASE_URL` already holds the
 *      superuser secret and a distinct one would add nothing — and prints the
 *      resulting connection string.
 *
 * Only the final URL goes to stdout, so a shell can capture it directly with
 * `$(...)`; every diagnostic goes to stderr.
