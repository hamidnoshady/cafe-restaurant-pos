/**
 * A Postgres-wire server backed by PGlite, so the database integration suite
 * can run where no real Postgres is available.
 *
 * Why this exists: `npm run test:db` needs a server it can reach over TCP with
 * `pg`, and each suite creates its own scratch database (`pos_<suite>_<uuid>`),
 * migrates it, and drops it afterwards. PGlite is a genuine Postgres compiled
 * to WASM, so it runs the real SQL — but one instance *is* one database, and
 * `@electric-sql/pglite-socket` serves its single instance to every connection
 * regardless of the database named in the startup packet. Pointing the suite
 * straight at it silently lands every connection back on `postgres`, which has
 * none of the migrations; the failures then look like connection errors rather
 * than "you are on the wrong database".
 *
 * So this listens on one port, reads the startup packet to learn which
 * database the client wants, and forwards the connection to a per-database
 * PGLiteSocketServer that it starts on demand on an ephemeral port. Each
 * database therefore gets its own real instance, and CREATE/DROP DATABASE in
 * the maintenance connection are no-ops that simply make the name resolvable.
 *
 * This is a local convenience, NOT a replacement for CI. PGlite serves one
 * connection at a time per instance (run the suite with DB_POOL_MAX=1) and so
 * cannot exercise the cross-session contention that branch-service.ts's
 * advisory locks exist for. The GitHub Actions `test` workflow, with a real
 * postgres:16 service, remains the authority.
 *
 * The two packages it needs are deliberately NOT in package.json: they carry a
 * ~27MB WASM build that nothing in the app or in CI uses, and adding them
 * would put that in every install for a fallback most contributors never
 * reach. Install them on demand instead.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm i --no-save @electric-sql/pglite @electric-sql/pglite-socket
 *   node scripts/pglite-wire-server.mjs &
 *   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:x@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres \
 *   DB_POOL_MAX=1 npm run test:db
 *
 * DB_POOL_MAX=1 is not optional: PGlite executes one statement at a time, and
 * a larger pool just queues sockets behind a backend that cannot use them.
