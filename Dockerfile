# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Production image for the POS app (Next.js custom server in server.ts).
#
# The app does NOT use `next start`; `npm start` runs `tsx server.ts`, which
# boots Next in production mode AND the `/ws` WebSocket sync channel. So tsx is
# a RUNTIME dependency: it is listed under "dependencies" in package.json,
# because the prod-deps stage below prunes dev dependencies out and a
# devDependency would be dropped from the image at exactly the moment the
# entrypoint calls it. Alongside it the runtime image keeps the source tree,
# `.next` build output, migrations and scripts — the scripts it runs at boot
# are TypeScript too, so anything they import (dotenv, pg) must also be a
# runtime dependency. src/lib/runtime-dependencies.test.ts guards this.
#
# Chromium IS installed in the runner: the app server renders print jobs
# itself now (src/app/api/print/* on top of src/lib/system-print/) — the
# browser's print client falls back to it when no local print agent answers
# on the till — and report PDF export (src/lib/pdf-render.ts) needs the same
# engine. Network (ESC/POS over TCP) printers are reachable from the
# container; Windows-installed queues still need the local print agent on the
# till PC, since a Linux container cannot enumerate the host's spooler.

# BuildKit cache between deploys (e.g. registry cache export/import), this

# from inside the Dockerfile alone. Harmless (a plain `docker build` with no
